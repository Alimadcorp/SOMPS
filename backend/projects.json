So I created DreamRankr!\n\nDreamRankr is a flask webApp which can host multiple ranking lists, in which the players can challenge each other to rise to the top. \n\nSo what can it do and how does it work?\nRanking options:\n     -By position: In this mode players can only challenge players with a higher ranking (e.g. Player A with the ranking 4 can challenge Player B with the Ranking 2, but not the other way around) and if the lower ranked person wins they move one rank up (Not dependant on defender ranking, just always one rank).\n     -By points: If you want to take how many matches a player actually played more into consideration, you should use this. If you finish a match you get 1 point and if you won the match you get another point, so 2 points. This system discourages high ranked players to just not play anymore!\n\nEncouragement:\n     -Lifetime all players leaderboard: In this leaderboard on the main page you can see how you compare to every other person in the app, so you dont get tunnelvision from your ranking.\n\nAdministration:\n     -Viewer and trainer permissions: If you do not have trainer permissions you simply can only view and not change anything.\n     -Automatic ending of rankings\n     -Players are saved seperatly of rankings (easy importing into new rankings) and can be in multiple\n\nSecurity/Legal Stuff:\n     -Password needed to view any information\n     -Easy in app editable privacy terms markdown file using EasyMDE. For countries with strict data protection laws.\n\nDev\n    -Thourogh logs\n\nPlanned features:\n     -Documentation tab: A place to put documents for the whole club to see e.g. manuals for equipment, current tournament plans, etc.\n     -Global message: Easily get messages to the players e.g. no training next week\n     -Tournament rankings\n     -Nice command line tool to comb through logs\n     -API and Esp32 Client\n\n##Disclosure as this was my first flask and python project I used AI to learn about this and I used AI to help me create the UI.

At its core is the Achernar Daemon, a headless service written in Rust and C++ that runs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson, or field laptops. This daemon handles camera interfacing (via V4L2 or ASI SDK), real-time frame capture, debayering, and hardware encoding, with integrated ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for on-device inference. It runs a local REST API (via actix-web or warp) to expose control interfaces.\n\nThe AI layer performs offline inference to suggest focus, exposure, and filter settings based on local environmental conditions, using quantized ONNX models that are confidence-based and never enforced. Imaging sessions are organized in a local-first folder structure, saving FITS files, logs, and preview videos, with append-only JSON logs and optional SQLite used for dashboard caching. When internet becomes available, sessions can be automatically synced to S3, Google Drive, or Dropbox via rclone or custom Rust logic.\n\nUsers interact through either a WebApp PWA, designed with React or SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS, or a Desktop App for advanced control. The WebApp is served from the edge device over a local Wi-Fi hotspot, enabling users to preview live streams (MJPEG or WebRTC), pick targets, and start imaging directly from their phone or tablet. The Desktop App‚Äîbuilt using Qt or Tauri‚Äîcaters to professionals with tools for FITS inspection, focus metric plotting, and full mount control (via INDI or ASCOM). All user sessions are secure, crash-safe, and never rely on cloud services for imaging, making Achernar robust for remote or off-grid astronomy. Cloud sync and remote dashboards activate only post-session, ensuring reliability with WebSockets for control and WebRTC tunnels for live previews, hosted optionally via Next.js or SvelteKit on platforms like Vercel.\n\nAlso, beacause im like activley working on this, i only have the github, im working on the readme and the demo link tho, i want to get an mvp done by like julys end","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/ibrahimshahid1/Achernar.tech","slack_id":"U07A1PR6XBP","created_at":"2025-06-16T23:38:54.158Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T23:38:54.158Z"},{"id":129,"title":"theakifmethod","description":"As a fitness enthusiast i want to create a website that includes all the important tools you need to get started with your fitness journey.\nI am going to add the following features\n1.Calorie Calculator\n2.Workout and Exercise form demonstration\n3.Workout Planner\n4.Progress Tracker","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/CSwithADHD/the-akif-method.git","slack_id":"U092BE79Q2C","created_at":"2025-06-16T18:14:54.690Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T18:14:54.690Z"},{"id":130,"title":"libsim","description":"a platform for book readers to find new friends and share their favorite works with each other. i wanted to create an application where i could save all of my manga and web novels in one space :)","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vempr/libsim/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://libsim.onrender.com","repo_link":"https://github.com/vempr/libsim","slack_id":"U09222ZKR7T","created_at":"2025-06-16T18:15:06.100Z","updated_at":"2025-07-19T00:10:59.036Z"},{"id":3203,"title":"Hack Circuit","description":"Hack Circuit is a modern web game with a medieval theme.

To fix it, I built TechnikTeam, a custom web platform that acts as the single source of truth for all our operations. It's a full-stack Java application designed to bring order and professionalism to our student-run events.\n\nüöÄ Core Features:\n\nEvent Scheduling & Crewing: Plan events, define roles (like \"sound tech\"), and assign crew members based on their skills.\nLive Event Dashboard: During a show, assigned members get a real-time dashboard with a group chat and a shared task list to stay in sync.\nQR-Powered Inventory: Catalog all our gear. Anyone can scan a QR code on a piece of equipment to see what it is and where it belongs, and crew members can check items in or out.\nInteractive Skills Matrix: A huge grid that visually tracks which crew members are trained on which equipment, making it easy to find the right person for the job.\nRole-Based Access: A full admin panel for leaders and a streamlined view for student crew members.\nTech Stack\nJava (Servlets/JSP), MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Apache Tomcat.\n\nWhat I Learned\nFull-Stack Development: I built the entire system myself, from designing the relational database schema in MySQL to coding the backend logic in Java and building the dynamic frontend with JSP and JavaScript.\nSolving a Real Problem: This wasn't a tutorial. I had to talk to my crew, understand their pain points, and design features that actually made their lives easier.\nComplex Systems Design: I learned how to architect interconnected features, like making the inventory reservations appear on the event pages and building the complex data queries needed for the interactive skills matrix.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Imjack1-cyber/TechnikTeam","slack_id":"U091MUWD64V","created_at":"2025-06-16T20:22:16.243Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T06:34:32.934Z"},{"id":256,"title":"BARCS Vaccination Clinic","description":"BARCS needs help automating the process of their vaccination clinics","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peppermint-juli/BARCS-Vaccination-Clinic/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/peppermint-juli/BARCS-Vaccination-Clinic","slack_id":"U0922TFUK09","created_at":"2025-06-16T20:23:12.654Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T20:25:31.592Z"},{"id":257,"title":"Blueprint Framework","description":"Essential toolkit for modding the Pterodactyl game panel, for both developers and system administrators.

At its core is the Achernar Daemon, a headless service written in Rust and C++ that runs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson, or field laptops. This daemon handles camera interfacing (via V4L2 or ASI SDK), real-time frame capture, debayering, and hardware encoding, with integrated ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for on-device inference. It runs a local REST API (via actix-web or warp) to expose control interfaces.\n\nThe AI layer performs offline inference to suggest focus, exposure, and filter settings based on local environmental conditions, using quantized ONNX models that are confidence-based and never enforced. Imaging sessions are organized in a local-first folder structure, saving FITS files, logs, and preview videos, with append-only JSON logs and optional SQLite used for dashboard caching. When internet becomes available, sessions can be automatically synced to S3, Google Drive, or Dropbox via rclone or custom Rust logic.\n\nUsers interact through either a WebApp PWA, designed with React or SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS, or a Desktop App for advanced control. The WebApp is served from the edge device over a local Wi-Fi hotspot, enabling users to preview live streams (MJPEG or WebRTC), pick targets, and start imaging directly from their phone or tablet. The Desktop App‚Äîbuilt using Qt or Tauri‚Äîcaters to professionals with tools for FITS inspection, focus metric plotting, and full mount control (via INDI or ASCOM). All user sessions are secure, crash-safe, and never rely on cloud services for imaging, making Achernar robust for remote or off-grid astronomy. Cloud sync and remote dashboards activate only post-session, ensuring reliability with WebSockets for control and WebRTC tunnels for live previews, hosted optionally via Next.js or SvelteKit on platforms like Vercel.\n\nAlso, beacause im like activley working on this, i only have the github, im working on the readme and the demo link tho, i want to get an mvp done by like julys end","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/ibrahimshahid1/Achernar.tech","slack_id":"U07A1PR6XBP","created_at":"2025-06-16T23:38:54.158Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T23:38:54.158Z"},{"id":378,"title":"Lightning","description":"Lightning is an extensible, lightweight, and fast app launcher for MacOS created using Rust and AppKit.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U0919GUQ4K1","created_at":"2025-06-16T23:41:17.118Z","updated_at":"2025-07-02T23:45:11.200Z"},{"id":379,"title":"SaifURLs","description":"This is a short URL service that I have built using ReactJS and React Router for the frontend and ExpressJS for the backend.

My project features a bot for Discord communities to create detailed timers, alarms, and reminders in their Discord server. This project is very special to me because it was actually my very first coding project back in 2020! A project so small also happened to be the project that helped me discover my true passion for coding, and helped me start my journey with Node.js development. For years now, Discord has lacked a native way to create timers, alarms, and reminders in Discord servers (a rather simple feature that many large communities have asked for). This bot is my attempt to finally solve that problem once and for all!\n<br>\nI started developing this bot back in middle school, but over time, it became too overwhelming with the constant changes to Discord's API. With factors outside of my reach like rising server costs and busy study nights throughout the week, I eventually decided to shut down the project. Well, my goal this week is to try and bring it back to life, and rebuild the entire thing from the ground up!\n<br>\nI'll be honest, being my first ever coding project, Timer Bot was definitely the sloppiest code I've ever written (nowhere near being production-ready). So I figured why not spend this Summer rewriting the entire thing from scratch. I recently picked up some new equipment to help keep my personal projects running (like websites and Immich servers), so this is my attempt of reviving it and giving it another life :)\n<br>\nFeatures:\n- (‚è±Ô∏è) Create precise timer countdowns with hours, minutes, and seconds.\n- (‚è∞) Schedule alerts for specific dates and times in your local time zone.\n- (üìù) Add titles and descriptions to your alarms to be notified of your upcoming events, goals, and more!\n- (üíæ) Save timer configurations with custom names for quick access anytime.\n- (üìã) Manage all your running timers, alarms, and reminders in one place.\n- (üåê) Set your local time zone for accurate alarm scheduling.\n- (üîî) Choose users or roles to notify when an event ends.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/TimerBot/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=759432068651548705&permissions=277025614848&scope=bot","repo_link":"https://github.com/BrianWalczak/TimerBot","slack_id":"U091MEESEDT","created_at":"2025-06-17T00:55:33.210Z","updated_at":"2025-07-21T01:15:59.384Z"},{"id":420,"title":"Portfolio - nabdev","description":"Personal portfolio showing off my projects, both past and present.

This deeply inspired me to create a solution that could empower them with the right information at the right time. I‚Äôve always been passionate about technology and artificial intelligence, and I wanted to apply these tools to solve real-world problems.\n\nThe idea of combining AI with agriculture came from observing how data-driven systems are transforming industries, while agriculture still faces huge gaps in access to information. I realized that even small changes‚Äîlike recommending the right crop or identifying pests early‚Äîcould have a big impact on a farmer‚Äôs income and food security. That‚Äôs what motivated me to build this AI-based platform: to support farmers, reduce resource waste, and make agriculture smarter and more sustainable.\n\nWhat it does\nThis project is an AI-powered farming assistant that helps farmers make smart, data-driven decisions to increase productivity and reduce waste. Based on inputs like weather, soil type, pH, NPKC levels, and farm size, it performs the following key functions:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crop using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), based on soil and environmental conditions.\n\nIrrigation & Water Prediction: Uses ANN to recommend the best irrigation method and estimate the right amount of water needed.\n\nYield Prediction: Predicts potential crop yield using ANN, helping farmers plan better.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: Uses a Random Forest model to recommend the correct type of fertilizer based on nutrient levels and crop type.\n\nFertilizer & Pesticide Quantity Estimation: An ANN model calculates the exact amount of fertilizer and pesticide needed, avoiding overuse and reducing costs.\n\nThe platform uses a Next.js frontend for user interaction and a FastAPI backend to process the inputs and return AI-generated recommendations. It aims to make farming more precise, efficient, and accessible for all.\n\nHow we built it\nWe built this project using a modern and scalable tech stack, combining machine learning models with a full-stack web application.\n\nFrontend: We used Next.js to build a responsive and interactive frontend that allows farmers to input data such as soil type, pH, NPKC levels, weather details, and farm size. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and mobile-compatible for easy access.\n\nBackend: The backend is powered by FastAPI, a fast and efficient Python web framework. It handles incoming requests, processes data, communicates with the machine learning models, and returns predictions to the frontend.\n\nMachine Learning Models:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze environmental and soil parameters.\n\nIrrigation and Water Requirement: An ANN predicts the most suitable irrigation method and how much water the crop will need.\n\nYield Prediction: Another ANN model estimates the potential yield based on input factors.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: A Random Forest classifier determines the best fertilizer based on soil nutrients and crop type.\n\nFertilizer & Pesticide Quantity: An ANN model calculates precise quantities required to avoid overuse.\n\nTraining & Data: We trained our models using agricultural datasets containing soil, weather, and crop data. Each model was evaluated and fine-tuned to improve accuracy and generalization.\n\nAll components are integrated seamlessly, ensuring that users get real-time, reliable insights through a web-based interface.\n\nChallenges we ran into\nBuilding this AI-powered farming assistant as a solo developer was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I encountered several obstacles throughout the development process:\n\nData Collection & Cleaning: Finding accurate, real-world agricultural datasets was difficult. I had to combine multiple sources and spend time cleaning, organizing, and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for model training.\n\nChoosing the Right Models: Selecting the best algorithms for different tasks required experimentation. I tried various models before finalizing ANN for crop prediction, water estimation, and yield prediction, and Random Forest for fertilizer recommendations. Fine-tuning them to get good accuracy without overfitting took time.\n\nFeature Selection: Understanding which input features (like pH, NPKC, farm size, etc.) were most relevant for each prediction task was a major challenge. I had to study agricultural practices and test combinations to get meaningful outputs.\n\nFrontend-Backend Integration: Connecting the Next.js frontend with the FastAPI backend was tricky. I ran into CORS issues and had to carefully manage API routing and request handling to make the data flow smooth and responsive.\n\nBalancing Accuracy & Simplicity: While aiming for high model accuracy, I also had to ensure the system remained simple enough for farmers to use. It was tough to design a system that‚Äôs both powerful and practical.\n\nDesigning a User-Friendly Interface: I had to make the UI intuitive, clean, and usable even on mobile devices, keeping in mind that many users may not be tech-savvy. Creating a smooth user experience took multiple design iterations.\n\nWorking alone pushed me to learn, adapt, and solve problems independently, and this experience helped me grow both technically and personally.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nBuilt a Complete AI Solution from Scratch: I successfully designed and developed an end-to-end AI system that predicts crops, irrigation needs, fertilizer types, and yield using real agricultural data.\n\nIntegrated Full Stack Technologies: I built a fully functional frontend using Next.js and connected it seamlessly to a FastAPI backend, managing both UI design and backend logic on my own.\n\nTrained Multiple ML Models: I implemented and trained multiple machine learning models (ANN and Random Forest) tailored for specific agricultural predictions, achieving good accuracy and real-world usability.\n\nDesigned a Clean, Usable Interface: I created a user-friendly web interface that‚Äôs responsive and accessible, ensuring ease of use even for farmers with limited technical knowledge.\n\nLearned & Applied Real-World Problem Solving: I tackled real-world issues like data inconsistency, model selection, and feature engineering, and found effective solutions through research and persistence.\n\nStayed Consistent & Self-Motivated: As a solo developer, I‚Äôm proud that I stayed committed, organized, and motivated through each phase‚Äîfrom planning and coding to testing and deployment.\n\nWhat we learned\nThroughout this project, I gained valuable experience and technical skills across multiple areas:\n\nApplied Machine Learning in Agriculture: I learned how to train and evaluate ML models like ANN and Random Forest for real-world agricultural use cases, including crop prediction, yield estimation, and fertilizer recommendations.\n\nFull-Stack Development: I improved my skills in both frontend and backend development using Next.js and FastAPI, learning how to integrate APIs, manage state, and build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.\n\nData Handling & Preprocessing: I learned the importance of clean, relevant data. I developed skills in data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare datasets for model training.\n\nModel Optimization & Evaluation: I gained hands-on experience in tuning hyperparameters, avoiding overfitting, and improving model accuracy and generalization.\n\nProblem-Solving & Debugging: I faced many technical challenges, especially in backend integration and model deployment, which taught me to troubleshoot issues methodically and stay persistent.\n\nUser-Centric Thinking: Designing an interface with farmers in mind taught me the value of simplicity and accessibility in tech solutions.\n\nThis project gave me the confidence to build practical AI tools and showed me how technology can make a real difference in critical fields like agriculture.\n\nWhat's next for FarmAI\nFarmAI is already live and deployed at farmai-nine.vercel.app(since its backend is hosted on Render's free tier its backend works slow sometimes), providing farmers with AI-powered recommendations. But this is just the beginning. Here's what's next for FarmAI:\n\nFrontend Enhancements & New Features: Continue improving the user interface for a better user experience, adding new functionalities, and optimizing the app for faster loading times.\n\nMultilingual Support: Add support for regional languages to make the platform more accessible to farmers from different areas, especially those in rural regions.\n\nIntegration with Real-Time APIs: Incorporate real-time weather and soil data APIs to provide more accurate predictions based on live environmental conditions.\n\nDatabase Expansion: Add more crop varieties, soil types, and fertilizer profiles to ensure the system caters to a broader set of geographical areas and farming needs.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"https://youtu.be/GV4v6cYUlmA?si=HHQWzP0Hty7TgCok","repo_link":"https://github.com/sidjain1239/farmai-frontend","slack_id":"U091RQ4BPEH","created_at":"2025-06-17T10:42:42.005Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T10:50:25.607Z"},{"id":733,"title":"YT-Downloader","description":"Download Videos in the highest quality avaiable (you have to install it for a live demo but there are also pictures at the github repository and a tutorial how to install it)","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luckmuc/Youtube-Downloader/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/Luckmuc/Youtube-Downloader/blob/main/README.md","repo_link":"https://github.com/Luckmuc/Youtube-Downloader","slack_id":"U091H6KD6TG","created_at":"2025-06-17T10:44:22.664Z","updated_at":"2025-07-19T08:46:32.267Z"},{"id":734,"title":"Video streaming to unity","description":"Stream video from web to unity vr ","category":"Mobile App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U091TJSHYSW","created_at":"2025-06-17T10:47:36.944Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T10:47:36.944Z"},{"id":735,"title":"StoryChain","description":"A collaborative storytelling mobile application - I have seen communities where people contribute to make a story.

It allows for loading customer and bike information from files, simulating reservations for electric and mechanical bikes, and calculating the costs associated with each customer. Customers can make reservations for mechanical bikes, which have no cost, or electric bikes, which have a base cost with discounts depending on their type (YOUNG or SENIOR). The system simulates 100 reservations for each day in June 2025, randomly assigning bikes to customers. At the end, the system calculates the total cost of each customer's reservations and determines who has the highest accumulated cost.\n\nThe code is structured into several classes, such as CityBike, Cliente, Bicicleta, Estacion, and Reserva, with key methods that allow loading data from binary and CSV files, simulating reservations, and calculating the associated costs. The system also handles possible errors in input data and ensures that bikes and stations are managed correctly. Information about customers, reservations, and costs is presented clearly and concisely, and the customer with the highest cost is easily identified, providing a clear view of the system's usage and costs.\n\nI programmed this in Spanish because it is my native language and the one I feel most comfortable with.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alainGit-stack/cityBike/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/alainGit-stack","slack_id":"U092D0ZPA8Y","created_at":"2025-06-17T18:07:04.210Z","updated_at":"2025-07-02T22:51:14.276Z"},{"id":1036,"title":"Personal Repository","description":"Relevant Personal Repository Created using Jekyll","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityapkatre/adityapkatre.github.io/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://adityapkatre.github.io/","repo_link":"https://github.com/adityapkatre/adityapkatre.github.io","slack_id":"U091MG0K16Z","created_at":"2025-06-17T18:07:55.741Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:16:40.898Z"},{"id":4219,"title":"Lumina","description":"Lumina\n\nA Minecraft mod that introduces a diverse collection of powerful crystals with a unique infusion combat system.\n\nFeatures\n\nCrystal Varieties\n- Teleportation Crystals: Escape the depths of caves instantly\n- Healing Crystals: Restore your health to full capacity\n- And many more!\n\nCrystal Infusion Combat System\nCrystals have two distinct use cases:\n- Normal Use: Safely harness crystal powers for your benefit\n- Infusion Combat: Use enchanted swords with the Inject enchantment to inflict crystal effects on other players!\n\nNegative Effects\nWhen infused into other players, crystals cause devastating effects:\n- Suffocation in open air\n- Lethal sensitivity to sunlight\n- And more deadly consequences to discover...","category":"Video Game","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U093S2WCPTK","created_at":"2025-06-28T12:50:34.411Z","updated_at":"2025-06-28T12:51:12.179Z"},{"id":1038,"title":"BloatOS","description":"Despite the name, BloatOS is the complete opposite of bloat.

MindPilot was born from this personal frustration, a tool that combines a smart focus assistant with an intelligent tutor, all in a lightweight and accessible web app.\n\nMindPilot allows you to start distraction-free focus sessions using a timer-based system while keeping track of your progress. But what makes it unique is the ability to ask any question or type any topic, and the built-in AI (powered by Cohere‚Äôs Command R+ model) explains it in a clear and understandable way. Whether you're struggling with a math concept, a programming topic, or even a piece of history, MindPilot is here to help.\n\nThe project is built using React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. It connects to the Cohere API to generate explanations in real time. A .env system is used to keep API keys safe, and the frontend and backend communicate through REST endpoints.\n\nThroughout the Summer of Making, I plan to extend MindPilot with new features such as:\n\nA personal progress dashboard\nSupport for multiple subjects and languages\nEnhanced session analytics\nAnd eventually, a mobile app version\nThe goal is to turn MindPilot into something that doesn't just help me but could help any student, self-learner, or curious mind around the world. It‚Äôs more than a study tool. It‚Äôs a digital co-pilot for your brain.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Frezzard2/MindPilot/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://mindpilot.onrender.com","repo_link":"https://github.com/Frezzard2/MindPilot","slack_id":"U08S0LWH27P","created_at":"2025-06-18T20:13:52.618Z","updated_at":"2025-07-20T18:24:30.252Z"},{"id":1488,"title":"Quivy","description":"Quivy is an online platform designed to make quizzes fun, social, and interactive.

My project is called BKFZ SubGHz (stands for Brian's Knockoff Flipper Zero, lol), a custom-built ESP32 device that can scan, record, and replay SubGHz radio signals, kind of like a DIY version of the Flipper Zero!\n<br>\nI built this last October after getting curious about how the Flipper Zero works, and wanted to recreate part of its functionality using cheap AliExpress parts. What started as a small side project I worked on when I was free quickly turned into one of the most challenging projects I‚Äôve ever made. \n<br>\nThe project is powered by an ESP32 (a Wi-Fi microcontroller that runs all the code) which serves a web interface you can access from your phone. The microcontroller is connected to a CC1101 transceiver, which is a chip capable of capturing and replaying SubGHz frequencies like 433‚ÄØMHz (the Flipper Zero uses this exact same chip from Texas Instruments).\n<br>\nThe entire thing is held together by a custom PCB designed in KiCad to keep it small, and it has added support for .sub files from real Flipper Zeros (so it‚Äôs compatible with public files from the flipper community). I also added support for preset modulation to match the Flipper Zero's configuration!\n<br>\nFeatures:\n- Frequency Analyzer: Scan and analyze nearby devices and their frequencies with ease.\n- Record RAW: Capture and record nearby signals with precise RSSI configuration.\n- Replay RAW: Replay previously captured signals from a file (no SD card required).\n- Preset Configuration: Configure the frequency of your device, and set the preset modulation (just like the Flipper Zero!).\n- Flipper Zero Support: Effortlessly replay any Flipper Zero SUB file, including the many publicly available ones, whenever you need.\n<br><br>\nThe following parts were used for the project (~$18.01 total, but you can make a minimal USB-powered one for ~$4.98)\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz/refs/heads/main/Other/Assembly%20Photos/Components/All%20Components.jpeg\" />","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz","repo_link":"https://github.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz","slack_id":"U091MEESEDT","created_at":"2025-06-18T22:27:05.593Z","updated_at":"2025-07-10T17:33:38.825Z"},{"id":3937,"title":"Glyph: Terminal-based Social Media","description":"a terminal-based social media service. for hackers, by hackers. pip install glyph-sh to get started.","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pizzalover125/glyph/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://glyph-sh.vercel.app/","repo_link":"https://github.com/pizzalover125/glyph","slack_id":"U07FD57JN67","created_at":"2025-06-26T15:57:40.298Z","updated_at":"2025-07-09T01:16:44.122Z"},{"id":1557,"title":"IDE","description":"üëΩÔ∏è My CLI to fastly initalize new projects ! üì¶Ô∏è","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Piarre/IDEv2/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Piarre/IDEv2","slack_id":"U0923LUS666","created_at":"2025-06-18T22:33:25.262Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T22:33:25.262Z"},{"id":2289,"title":"Upscale","description":"Upscale is a web platform that verifies and certifies professionals‚Äô skills in their chosen field, addressing biases in hiring (e.g., nationality-based stereotypes) by providing a transparent, data-driven evaluation of expertise.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U065R5BRFEX","created_at":"2025-06-20T20:21:30.573Z","updated_at":"2025-06-20T20:21:30.573Z"},{"id":1559,"title":"Tabzer","description":"A CLI tool to create, edit and share guitar tabs","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IHaveQuestions2010/tabzer/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/IHaveQuestions2010/tabzer","slack_id":"U091ZV9783X","created_at":"2025-06-18T22:34:36.368Z","updated_at":"2025-07-06T19:18:59.923Z"},{"id":4252,"title":"Personal Profile","description":"A personal profile website using HTML and CSS","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U091FQE9QR4","created_at":"2025-06-28T17:25:31.815Z","updated_at":"2025-06-28T17:25:31.815Z"},{"id":1561,"title":"Congueror Game","description":"Game where you conquer areas, towns and castles.","category":"Video Game","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/the-siili/ConguerorGame","slack_id":"U087BV39A4X","created_at":"2025-06-18T22:35:53.382Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T00:38:38.025Z"},{"id":1562,"title":"GuessMyLoadout","description":"A GuessMyRank like for Warzone","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Piarre/GuessMyLoadout","slack_id":"U0923LUS666","created_at":"2025-06-18T22:37:11.724Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T22:37:11.724Z"},{"id":2996,"title":"Statsapp","description":"A command-line tool that parses group chat export files from WhatsApp, and performs some data analysis, outputting CSV files that can be visualized in an app like Flourish.","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MMK21Hub/statsapp/master/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/MMK21Hub/statsapp/#usage-guide","repo_link":"https://github.com/MMK21Hub/statsapp/","slack_id":"U073M5L9U13","created_at":"2025-06-22T21:01:52.183Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T21:01:52.183Z"},{"id":1564,"title":"Science Bowl Pro","description":"I am working on an app that will assist others with studying for the National Science Bowl Competition.

Everyone receives a secret word except for the Impostor. Now, everyone has to say a word. The crewmates have to say a word which tells the other crewmates that they themselves are not the Impostor, and the Impostor tries to mislead them into thinking that person isn't the Impostor. After a few rounds, everyone votes for one player they think is the Impostor. If they get it right, they win; if not, the Impostor wins.\n\nExample: The word is beach\n\nCrewmate1 says: Cocktail (because of beach bar and such things)\nCrewmate2 says: Castle (because of building a sandcastle)\nImpostor1 says: Sun ( because the Imposter understood that the word may be sth about vacation/beach or sth like that)\n\nCurrently, many students, like myself, are playing at school in free time and, for example, in breaks.\n\nThere are many apps being used, but I thought about the people who don't have many friends to play with because there maybe want to play the game too but cant ( xD )  . That's why I want to work on an app where you can play it yourself with AI friends.\n\nI know it sounds like a troll project, and yeah, it was a random thought I had at school, but I kind of liked it. That's why I am programming it.\n\nMy goal is to make an Android & iOS compatible app where you can just play the Impostor game with a few AI Agents.\n\nI also chose this project because normally I mainly write Python or Java backend code, and I want to challenge myself to program some React Native.","category":"Mobile App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockplacer4/ImposterGameWithAI/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/blockplacer4/ImposterGameWithAI","slack_id":"U091Q6XL5R8","created_at":"2025-06-19T20:29:09.005Z","updated_at":"2025-06-28T22:22:33.369Z"},{"id":1931,"title":"Pyminder","description":"A simple reminder using Python","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Thoracide/Pyminder","slack_id":"U091UHHSXMJ","created_at":"2025-06-19T20:31:13.593Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T20:33:29.161Z"},{"id":1932,"title":"About TIFA","description":"It was like a small intro about me and some of the great experiences I had with the Hack Club, especially the branch I lead which is STEM Egypt Hack Club.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TifA12-sta/About-TIFA/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://tifa12-sta.github.io/About-TIFA/","repo_link":"https://github.com/TifA12-sta/About-TIFA","slack_id":"U07K3PTJSUU","created_at":"2025-06-19T20:32:13.343Z","updated_at":"2025-07-21T03:06:53.280Z"},{"id":1933,"title":"Snippix is a simple and awesome code art generator","description":"Want to turn your code/message into cool, retro pixel art?

This deeply inspired me to create a solution that could empower them with the right information at the right time. I‚Äôve always been passionate about technology and artificial intelligence, and I wanted to apply these tools to solve real-world problems.\n\nThe idea of combining AI with agriculture came from observing how data-driven systems are transforming industries, while agriculture still faces huge gaps in access to information. I realized that even small changes‚Äîlike recommending the right crop or identifying pests early‚Äîcould have a big impact on a farmer‚Äôs income and food security. That‚Äôs what motivated me to build this AI-based platform: to support farmers, reduce resource waste, and make agriculture smarter and more sustainable.\n\nWhat it does\nThis project is an AI-powered farming assistant that helps farmers make smart, data-driven decisions to increase productivity and reduce waste. Based on inputs like weather, soil type, pH, NPKC levels, and farm size, it performs the following key functions:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crop using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), based on soil and environmental conditions.\n\nIrrigation & Water Prediction: Uses ANN to recommend the best irrigation method and estimate the right amount of water needed.\n\nYield Prediction: Predicts potential crop yield using ANN, helping farmers plan better.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: Uses a Random Forest model to recommend the correct type of fertilizer based on nutrient levels and crop type.\n\nFertilizer & Pesticide Quantity Estimation: An ANN model calculates the exact amount of fertilizer and pesticide needed, avoiding overuse and reducing costs.\n\nThe platform uses a Next.js frontend for user interaction and a FastAPI backend to process the inputs and return AI-generated recommendations. It aims to make farming more precise, efficient, and accessible for all.\n\nHow we built it\nWe built this project using a modern and scalable tech stack, combining machine learning models with a full-stack web application.\n\nFrontend: We used Next.js to build a responsive and interactive frontend that allows farmers to input data such as soil type, pH, NPKC levels, weather details, and farm size. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and mobile-compatible for easy access.\n\nBackend: The backend is powered by FastAPI, a fast and efficient Python web framework. It handles incoming requests, processes data, communicates with the machine learning models, and returns predictions to the frontend.\n\nMachine Learning Models:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze environmental and soil parameters.\n\nIrrigation and Water Requirement: An ANN predicts the most suitable irrigation method and how much water the crop will need.\n\nYield Prediction: Another ANN model estimates the potential yield based on input factors.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: A Random Forest classifier determines the best fertilizer based on soil nutrients and crop type.\n\nFertilizer & Pesticide Quantity: An ANN model calculates precise quantities required to avoid overuse.\n\nTraining & Data: We trained our models using agricultural datasets containing soil, weather, and crop data. Each model was evaluated and fine-tuned to improve accuracy and generalization.\n\nAll components are integrated seamlessly, ensuring that users get real-time, reliable insights through a web-based interface.\n\nChallenges we ran into\nBuilding this AI-powered farming assistant as a solo developer was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I encountered several obstacles throughout the development process:\n\nData Collection & Cleaning: Finding accurate, real-world agricultural datasets was difficult. I had to combine multiple sources and spend time cleaning, organizing, and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for model training.\n\nChoosing the Right Models: Selecting the best algorithms for different tasks required experimentation. I tried various models before finalizing ANN for crop prediction, water estimation, and yield prediction, and Random Forest for fertilizer recommendations. Fine-tuning them to get good accuracy without overfitting took time.\n\nFeature Selection: Understanding which input features (like pH, NPKC, farm size, etc.) were most relevant for each prediction task was a major challenge. I had to study agricultural practices and test combinations to get meaningful outputs.\n\nFrontend-Backend Integration: Connecting the Next.js frontend with the FastAPI backend was tricky. I ran into CORS issues and had to carefully manage API routing and request handling to make the data flow smooth and responsive.\n\nBalancing Accuracy & Simplicity: While aiming for high model accuracy, I also had to ensure the system remained simple enough for farmers to use. It was tough to design a system that‚Äôs both powerful and practical.\n\nDesigning a User-Friendly Interface: I had to make the UI intuitive, clean, and usable even on mobile devices, keeping in mind that many users may not be tech-savvy. Creating a smooth user experience took multiple design iterations.\n\nWorking alone pushed me to learn, adapt, and solve problems independently, and this experience helped me grow both technically and personally.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nBuilt a Complete AI Solution from Scratch: I successfully designed and developed an end-to-end AI system that predicts crops, irrigation needs, fertilizer types, and yield using real agricultural data.\n\nIntegrated Full Stack Technologies: I built a fully functional frontend using Next.js and connected it seamlessly to a FastAPI backend, managing both UI design and backend logic on my own.\n\nTrained Multiple ML Models: I implemented and trained multiple machine learning models (ANN and Random Forest) tailored for specific agricultural predictions, achieving good accuracy and real-world usability.\n\nDesigned a Clean, Usable Interface: I created a user-friendly web interface that‚Äôs responsive and accessible, ensuring ease of use even for farmers with limited technical knowledge.\n\nLearned & Applied Real-World Problem Solving: I tackled real-world issues like data inconsistency, model selection, and feature engineering, and found effective solutions through research and persistence.\n\nStayed Consistent & Self-Motivated: As a solo developer, I‚Äôm proud that I stayed committed, organized, and motivated through each phase‚Äîfrom planning and coding to testing and deployment.\n\nWhat we learned\nThroughout this project, I gained valuable experience and technical skills across multiple areas:\n\nApplied Machine Learning in Agriculture: I learned how to train and evaluate ML models like ANN and Random Forest for real-world agricultural use cases, including crop prediction, yield estimation, and fertilizer recommendations.\n\nFull-Stack Development: I improved my skills in both frontend and backend development using Next.js and FastAPI, learning how to integrate APIs, manage state, and build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.\n\nData Handling & Preprocessing: I learned the importance of clean, relevant data. I developed skills in data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare datasets for model training.\n\nModel Optimization & Evaluation: I gained hands-on experience in tuning hyperparameters, avoiding overfitting, and improving model accuracy and generalization.\n\nProblem-Solving & Debugging: I faced many technical challenges, especially in backend integration and model deployment, which taught me to troubleshoot issues methodically and stay persistent.\n\nUser-Centric Thinking: Designing an interface with farmers in mind taught me the value of simplicity and accessibility in tech solutions.\n\nThis project gave me the confidence to build practical AI tools and showed me how technology can make a real difference in critical fields like agriculture.\n\nWhat's next for FarmAI\nFarmAI is already live and deployed at farmai-nine.vercel.app(since its backend is hosted on Render's free tier its backend works slow sometimes), providing farmers with AI-powered recommendations. But this is just the beginning. Here's what's next for FarmAI:\n\nFrontend Enhancements & New Features: Continue improving the user interface for a better user experience, adding new functionalities, and optimizing the app for faster loading times.\n\nMultilingual Support: Add support for regional languages to make the platform more accessible to farmers from different areas, especially those in rural regions.\n\nIntegration with Real-Time APIs: Incorporate real-time weather and soil data APIs to provide more accurate predictions based on live environmental conditions.\n\nDatabase Expansion: Add more crop varieties, soil types, and fertilizer profiles to ensure the system caters to a broader set of geographical areas and farming needs.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"https://youtu.be/GV4v6cYUlmA?si=HHQWzP0Hty7TgCok","repo_link":"https://github.com/sidjain1239/farmai-frontend","slack_id":"U091RQ4BPEH","created_at":"2025-06-17T10:42:42.005Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T10:50:25.607Z"},{"id":2672,"title":"Etymology Extension","description":"Firefox extension that let's you check etymology of the selected word.

The system stores user ratings and calculates an average rating for each movie, which is displayed alongside the movie‚Äôs details.\n\nAdministrators can manage movie data, including adding, updating, or deleting movie entries. The system ensures that each user can rate a movie only once, but they can update their rating if needed. It may also include search and filter options to help users find movies by genre, release year, or rating.

For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1 could represent white.\n\nIn this sense, then, is an image just a bitmap (i.e., a map of bits). For more colorful images, you simply need more bits per pixel. A file format (like BMP, JPEG, or PNG) that supports ‚Äú24-bit color‚Äù uses 24 bits per pixel. (BMP actually supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color.)\n\nA 24-bit BMP uses 8 bits to signify the amount of red in a pixel‚Äôs color, 8 bits to signify the amount of green in a pixel‚Äôs color, and 8 bits to signify the amount of blue in a pixel‚Äôs color. If you‚Äôve ever heard of RGB color, well, there you have it: red, green, blue.\n\nIf the R, G, and B values of some pixel in a BMP are, say, 0xff, 0x00, and 0x00 in hexadecimal, that pixel is purely red, as 0xff (otherwise known as 255 in decimal) implies ‚Äúa lot of red,‚Äù while 0x00 and 0x00 imply ‚Äúno green‚Äù and ‚Äúno blue,‚Äù respectively. In this problem, you‚Äôll manipulate these R, G, and B values of individual pixels, ultimately creating your very own image filters.\n\nIn a file called helpers.c in a folder called filter-less, write a program to apply filters to BMPs.\n\nThis is a problem from CS50x, Problem Set 4.","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code50/120336831/main/filter-less/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/code50/120336831/tree/main/filter-less","slack_id":"U091PCWGNBX","created_at":"2025-06-22T17:33:16.800Z","updated_at":"2025-07-02T22:38:52.846Z"},{"id":2928,"title":"MoveTimer","description":"Reminding you to move regularly while doing things like coding or playing games.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HQ2000-Rust/MoveTimer/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/HQ2000-Rust/MoveTimer","slack_id":"U091KJSPK6X","created_at":"2025-06-22T17:33:27.108Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T17:33:27.108Z"},{"id":2929,"title":"Notfall","description":"An app to notify loved ones about incidents.","category":"Mobile App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U09286BD46R","created_at":"2025-06-22T17:37:02.487Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T17:37:02.487Z"},{"id":2930,"title":"Risk","description":"Java Risk game. 3D Graphics from scratch, and Multiplayer functionality","category":"Video Game","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pl3wt0/APCSA2025RISK/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Pl3wt0/APCSA2025RISK","slack_id":"U091PSGL468","created_at":"2025-06-22T17:42:05.554Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T17:42:05.554Z"},{"id":2931,"title":"Yet Another Simple Agent","description":"CLI tool to make it easier to have agents do quick tasks","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Idkbythispoint/YetAnotherSimpleAgent","slack_id":"U0820S64VEJ","created_at":"2025-06-22T17:49:32.175Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T17:49:32.175Z"},{"id":2932,"title":"Neovim Config","description":"Just my neovim config :D","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arinji2/nvim-config/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Arinji2/nvim-config","slack_id":"U0934E7U2PJ","created_at":"2025-06-22T17:53:33.974Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T17:53:33.974Z"},{"id":2933,"title":"BruhGrow Tools","description":"Save time, boost productivity, and focus on what matters most","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U092GSTLW05","created_at":"2025-06-22T17:53:59.390Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T19:37:56.413Z"},{"id":2934,"title":"2048: Endgame","description":"2048: Endgame<hr>Bash Your Way Through Multipliers, Dividers, and the Forbidden 1!\n<br>Features\n<hr>- Play 2048 in your terminal with simple keyboard commands.\n- New multiplier feature.

It‚Äôs not a key remapper. It‚Äôs not a hotkey thing. It‚Äôs more like: ‚ÄúWhat if this random keypad controlled your entire life?‚Äù\nBuilt for people who are either extremely efficient or extremely lazy (ideally both). I made this because I got tired of doing the same 6 actions 80 times a day and figured a dedicated macro keyboard deserved a bit more respect.\n\nFeatures (allegedly)\n\nDevice Isolation\nPick any HID keyboard and make it invisible to Windows. Now it only talks to KeyLayer. Like a walkie-talkie but way nerdier.\nVisual Macro Editor\nA drag-and-drop grid thing. You connect boxes. The boxes do things. Like a flowchart, if flowcharts had keypresses and HTTP requests.\nLayers\nMultiple keymaps per device. You can toggle them, hold them, or activate them conditionally. Basically like having 12 keyboards in one, but without the cable mess.\nAction Types\nIt simulates input, launches apps, takes screenshots, clicks stuff, types things, moves the mouse, yells at the OS, and maybe opens a file if you're lucky.\nTemplate System\nSave your macros. Share them. Never open your email with your actual hands again.\nImport/Export\nJSON, XML, AutoHotkey, PowerShell, or some compressed binary thing I half-documented.\nMacro Recorder\nPress record. Do a thing. Watch it get turned into a macro with weird timing values you'll have to clean up later.\nProfiles & Settings\nStored in JSON because YAML made me angry one time. Backup/restore works unless it doesn‚Äôt.\nStuff That Technically Works\n\nReal-time HID scanning\nMulti-device support\nLive testing in the macro editor\nNode zoom/pan so you can pretend it‚Äôs Blender\nUndo/Redo for when you mess up repeatedly\nTemplated macros with metadata nobody uses\nEncryption (for your deeply private macros)\nExample Use Cases\nGaming: Press one key to press three other keys. Wow.\nProductivity: Insert email templates so you don‚Äôt have to pretend to type anymore.\nDevelopment: Make a button that builds and runs your code because clicking things is exhausting.\nQA: Automate testing so your soul can remain intact.\n\nTroubleshooting\nDevice doesn‚Äôt show up? Plug it in better.\nIsolation fails? Probably another app being weird.\nNothing works? Try turning it off and on again.\nLaggy? Adjust some obscure buffer setting until it's less laggy.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UltimaCodes/KeyLayer/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/UltimaCodes/KeyLayer/releases/tag/alphaMain","repo_link":"https://github.com/UltimaCodes/KeyLayer","slack_id":"U082WT6L2H2","created_at":"2025-06-26T10:26:43.684Z","updated_at":"2025-07-07T13:24:54.805Z"},{"id":2966,"title":"Crossdump","description":"A cross-platform crash-dumping mechanism for post-mortem debugging.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://codeberg.org/shimstart/crossdump/src/branch/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://codeberg.org/shimstart/crossdump","slack_id":"U0927ESH9BL","created_at":"2025-06-22T19:43:10.948Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T21:12:28.197Z"},{"id":2967,"title":"Weet","description":"Weet is a chatbot fine-tuned off of all of the random things that are said on slack.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WyattBrashear/Weet/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/WyattBrashear/Weet","slack_id":"U081PP0P9SB","created_at":"2025-06-22T19:43:11.034Z","updated_at":"2025-06-28T19:33:16.332Z"},{"id":2968,"title":"Waveband Project (WIP)","description":"This is my project for Waveband.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U0827CL509G","created_at":"2025-06-22T19:47:24.235Z","updated_at":"2025-06-28T03:12:08.164Z"},{"id":2969,"title":"Coltie Project","description":"A project I am doing for Coltie, a platform for academics","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Dheirya/coltie-project","slack_id":"U08AC6D869G","created_at":"2025-06-22T19:55:47.401Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T19:55:47.401Z"},{"id":2970,"title":"Ligma ","description":"Ligma Fork is a funny cooking website that turns your kitchen into a creative playground.

The system analyzes user profiles, their current group memberships, and department data to intelligently recommend group assignments. It validates these recommendations against organizational policies enforced by OPA, ensuring compliant and optimized group assignments.\n\nThe solution includes:\n1. A React-based Frontend for user selection and result visualization.\n2. A FastAPI-based Backend to handle agent requests and serve the LangGraph engine.\n3. An Okta API Integration Layer for real-time user and group data retrieval.\n4. An OPA Policy Evaluation Layer to block non-compliant group assignments.\n5. Real-time logs for step-by-step traceability.\nThis project streamlines identity governance, enhances security posture, and provides an interactive interface for role analysis and decision-making.\n\nWrapper Layer: Orchestrating the System\nThe Wrapper Layer acts as the central orchestration engine that connects the frontend, backend, LangGraph agent, Okta APIs, and the OPA policy engine in a seamless flow. It provides a unified API interface that simplifies interactions across these distributed components.\n\nKey functions of the Wrapper Layer:\n1. Data Aggregation:\nCollects user and group information from the Okta API and serves it in a cleaned, frontend-friendly format.\n2. Process Invocation:\nSends user data to the LangGraph agent for group suggestion and orchestrates the complete flow from input selection to final decision.\n3.

Vendors can sign up easily, manage inventory, and handle orders through a simple interface without any technical expertise. Payments are processed securely through UPI and cards, and deliveries are managed via store-based coordination or local delivery partners.\n\nThis project is my attempt to democratize access to quick-commerce infrastructure by giving real-world stores the same digital capabilities as corporate chains ‚Äî without needing to own a warehouse or a private delivery fleet.

So I decided to build my website using it and at the same time try this framework. In addition, I am happy that I did so. I loved this framework. \nI take some time to understand how things work, and the learning curve of Astro is faster than most other frameworks. I suggest it for anyone, especially for the SSG sites like portfolios and blogs. Since Astro works to serve zero JavaScript by default, it makes the whole page HTML, which is best for SEO.\n\nLet's talk about my website:\nMy website includes my portfolio, blog, projects, repos, education, technologies, now page, biolink (you could only get to by going to /bio from the search bar), and contact page. All these pages are built using Astro, which includes the functionality of the contact form.\nThe portfolio includes sections for favourite technologies, projects, and current education, and all the sections include a link to a full page of info, not just what appears in the portfolio.\nAll the website content is written as markdown files or mdx files that enable me to change the content of the whole website by just using the integrated cms (decap cms).\nI have used some beautiful astro community integrations rather than the official integrations, which are vite-pwa/astro and astro-collection-search. That makes setting something like the search and PWA easier for the website. \nOne of the largest problems that I faced during building this website is that when you use clientrouter, Astro downloads the page content, not the scripts, and that could affect things like the theme toggle and the search overlay handling, after swapping, and you should use astro:after-swap lifecycle event from astro to solve that, but things usually do not work as expected. \nYou may ask what the benefit of the client router is; it enables you to move between pages without reloading the whole page with smooth transitions.\nRather than suffer, I make Astro my favourite frontend framework.\n\nWhat AI helped with:\n- Styling my website and choosing colors\n- Solving some problems (wasn't very useful in most cases since Astro was still considered a new framework, so most of his knowledge is old, even before Astro 5, but it was considered helpful). \n- Writing some of the page's content and the readme\n- Helped in creating the website favicon.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saifabdelrazek011/site/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://www.saifabdelrazek.com","repo_link":"https://github.com/saifabdelrazek011/site","slack_id":"U0666VATMT5","created_at":"2025-06-25T20:12:23.061Z","updated_at":"2025-07-18T21:06:23.211Z"},{"id":963,"title":"NetSour","description":"TUI For scanning network packets","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegoodduck/NetSour/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/thegoodduck/NetSour","repo_link":"https://github.com/thegoodduck/NetSour","slack_id":"U09224R2XT3","created_at":"2025-06-17T16:27:44.101Z","updated_at":"2025-06-26T20:23:08.448Z"},{"id":3763,"title":"MKSync","description":"Manga-Kobo Sync - Sync your Manga between compatible manga readers and your Kobo eReader device!","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fily-gif/MKSync/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/fily-gif/MKSync","slack_id":"U082U8N45B5","created_at":"2025-06-25T20:18:02.336Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T20:18:02.336Z"},{"id":1591,"title":"Name","description":"Description","category":"Video Game","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U092F2WS70R","created_at":"2025-06-19T00:38:28.344Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T00:38:28.344Z"},{"id":3765,"title":"Weather App","description":"A realtime weather app with my_location feature and forecast for the next 24 hours","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GRACE-wDEV/Weather-App/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://grace-wdev.github.io/Weather-App/","repo_link":"https://github.com/GRACE-wDEV/Weather-App","slack_id":"U0840LYSD1D","created_at":"2025-06-25T20:18:58.494Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T20:20:30.216Z"},{"id":3766,"title":"The Ultimate Bike Odometer","description":"This is a project demonstrating code to my ultimate bike odometer, with built in GPS (hopefully) A 3.5\" LCD and a ~1 inch OLED","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U08AZBA9NFJ","created_at":"2025-06-25T20:22:09.584Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T20:22:09.584Z"},{"id":3767,"title":"Kotleciak's  chess","description":"I created this game about 7-8 months ago for my teacher.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"https://kotleciak.github.io/Szachownica/?fbclid=IwY2xjawLJOCBleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHg_NlpDCV4slW1qba5oE09p8-EXkdai9U_sP3Kuk0oiIw19S1tNFtCd4nXIH_aem_6FKvVAolzTaV8R-cUkeY8g","repo_link":"https://github.com/Kotleciak/Szachownica","slack_id":"U07VCDTNYNB","created_at":"2025-06-25T20:32:33.947Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T20:34:29.572Z"},{"id":3768,"title":"Lower Saxony Old Exam Searcher","description":"The official state run website that publishes old exams in Lower Saxony is not that intuitive to use, so I decided to create my more intuitive version of it.

It‚Äôs not a key remapper. It‚Äôs not a hotkey thing. It‚Äôs more like: ‚ÄúWhat if this random keypad controlled your entire life?‚Äù\nBuilt for people who are either extremely efficient or extremely lazy (ideally both). I made this because I got tired of doing the same 6 actions 80 times a day and figured a dedicated macro keyboard deserved a bit more respect.\n\nFeatures (allegedly)\n\nDevice Isolation\nPick any HID keyboard and make it invisible to Windows. Now it only talks to KeyLayer. Like a walkie-talkie but way nerdier.\nVisual Macro Editor\nA drag-and-drop grid thing. You connect boxes. The boxes do things. Like a flowchart, if flowcharts had keypresses and HTTP requests.\nLayers\nMultiple keymaps per device. You can toggle them, hold them, or activate them conditionally. Basically like having 12 keyboards in one, but without the cable mess.\nAction Types\nIt simulates input, launches apps, takes screenshots, clicks stuff, types things, moves the mouse, yells at the OS, and maybe opens a file if you're lucky.\nTemplate System\nSave your macros. Share them. Never open your email with your actual hands again.\nImport/Export\nJSON, XML, AutoHotkey, PowerShell, or some compressed binary thing I half-documented.\nMacro Recorder\nPress record. Do a thing. Watch it get turned into a macro with weird timing values you'll have to clean up later.\nProfiles & Settings\nStored in JSON because YAML made me angry one time. Backup/restore works unless it doesn‚Äôt.\nStuff That Technically Works\n\nReal-time HID scanning\nMulti-device support\nLive testing in the macro editor\nNode zoom/pan so you can pretend it‚Äôs Blender\nUndo/Redo for when you mess up repeatedly\nTemplated macros with metadata nobody uses\nEncryption (for your deeply private macros)\nExample Use Cases\nGaming: Press one key to press three other keys. Wow.\nProductivity: Insert email templates so you don‚Äôt have to pretend to type anymore.\nDevelopment: Make a button that builds and runs your code because clicking things is exhausting.\nQA: Automate testing so your soul can remain intact.\n\nTroubleshooting\nDevice doesn‚Äôt show up?

To solve this issue, AP Study Tool uses an aesthetic pink UI theme to ensure that students do not get distracted by a boring old UI when studying for their AP exams. The web app explains big ideas, includes helpful resources, and may even have an AI helper in the future!

EasyGPA includes an aesthetic sunset themed UI to ensure that the web-app is pleasing to the eye and not just plain white (which is pretty boring to the user). EasyGPA has been proven to be 100% accurate, and if you don't trust me, you can compare your GPA calculated by EasyGPA with your GPA on your report card (when you receive it). They should be exactly the same!\n\nWhat EasyGPA does: EasyGPA takes two different user inputs for the unweighted GPA - one is the number of classes and the other is the user's grade in each class. For the weighted GPA, it takes three user inputs with the extra one being the class level. After the user inputs have been filled out, EasyGPA then assigns each grade a certain number of grade points based on the standard GPA scale from College Board, calculates the sum of all of the grade points, and divides the sum by the number of classes to get a final GPA!\n\nWhy I made EasyGPA: I made EasyGPA because as a a high school student, I am always eager to know what my GPA is (unweighted and weighted) before my report card is sent out at the end of the year. In the past, I have resorted to ChatGPT for calculating my GPA, but it turns out that ChatGPT gave me a totally wrong result. Thus, I tried GPA calculators available on the internet, but the majority of those asked for the number of \"credits\" each of my classes are worth and I had no idea what that meant! If I left that field empty, the website wouldn't even let me calculate my GPA. That's when I began to research how to actually calculate both your unweighted and weighted GPAs. But any time I wanted to calculate my GPA, I had to actually pull out a calculator and perform the mathematical operations which was pretty tiring. I wanted to streamline this process, for not just myself but also for other students just like me, hence I created EasyGPA!\n\nHow I made EasyGPA: I made EasyGPA using mainly HTML, although CSS was used for styling the UI, and JavaScript was responsible for the actual calculations and input generation.\n\nWhat I struggled with and learned along the way: One of the things I struggled with was making sure the GPA calculations were accurate, especially with the weighted GPA calculator which takes 3 different factors into account. Also, I was having some spacing issues as there was a huge gap between the EasyGPA header and the unweighted GPA calculator which looked pretty ugly in terms of the UI. Something I learned about along the way was how to handle user input effectively in JavaScript and just overall web-app styling.\nREAD: How AI was used: I originally had the GPA calculator code in Python as it was made for an AP CSP project, but to integrate the calculator into a web-app I needed it to be in JavaScript. That's where AI came in to help me convert code from Python --> JavaScript for an easy web-app integration!","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DogCosmo/EasyGPA/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://easygpatool.vercel.app/","repo_link":"https://github.com/DogCosmo/EasyGPA","slack_id":"U092KBJMA7L","created_at":"2025-07-02T05:19:27.599Z","updated_at":"2025-07-04T22:46:31.114Z"},{"id":5280,"title":"Midnight Cabin","description":"Midnight cabin website, help channels, content, bot...","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"https://midnightcabin.tech","repo_link":"https://github.com/justdanielndev/everything-midnightcabin","slack_id":"U08T4JQJRJA","created_at":"2025-07-04T11:02:46.120Z","updated_at":"2025-07-07T16:27:19.689Z"},{"id":4872,"title":"Bitwarden Auto-Backup Manager","description":"Welcome!

This left us users without an easy way to securely back up our vault data in the event of a server shutdown or other emergency. This Electronjs-based application fixes this very problem by providing reliable, automatic backups you control.\n<br>\nThe best part? Bitwarden Auto-Backup Manager is powered by the official Bitwarden clients library (found on GitHub) for backup file generation, as well as CryptoJS for PBKDF2 encryption/decryption methods, allowing you to decrypt your backups at any time! Your vault is synced with the help of the Bitwarden Desktop app (for credentials) and the Bitwarden API.\n<br>\nI built this application back in July of 2024, but I noticed that it lacks many expected features and nice-to-haves.

That's right - with today's technology, scientists can preserve human tissue and organs at sufficiently low temperatures. The only problem is that when the organs are being thawed back, additional ice crystal growth - known as ice recrystallization - occurs, damaging the tissue. \n\nA number of researchers are trying to develop ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) technologies. The purpose of the CyrstalEyes software is to aid their efforts by providing a tool that measures the size and density of ice crystals. Determining the efficacy of IRI antifreeze proteins requires analyzing the shape and size of microscopic ice growth, which, through traditional analysis, requires hours of manual labor. Imagine drawing thousands of contours with your hand. That's what my mentor first had to do, but as her intern, I developed this software that can automatically extract features from microscope images. \n\nI'm using Python and a machine learning library called Cellpose to create my app. Feel free to try it out!

The Pomodoro Timer follows the 25-minute work session model, allowing users to start, pause, and reset sessions to maintain focus and structure their workflow. The To-Do List enables users to add tasks with categories, priority levels, and scheduled times, all of which are saved in the browser using localStorage. A built-in alarm checks tasks every minute and alerts the user when it's time. Users can also mark tasks as done or delete them as needed. The Dark Mode toggle switches the theme by adding a CSS class to the body, improving visual comfort. The project was developed by first building the layout in HTML, styling it with CSS for modern visuals and responsive behavior, then coding all interactive features in JavaScript, including the timer logic, task handling, theme switching, and alarm system.

The game increases in difficulty with more pigeons and faster movement, encouraging quick, accurate signing.\n\nKey challenges included integrating the ASL recognition with Pygame, which required redesigning the layout to make both systems work together. Despite these challenges, the creator successfully built a working game and gained experience in Pygame and computer vision.\n\nFuture plans include expanding the system to recognize full ASL words, allowing players to practice more advanced communication skills.","category":"Video Game","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U070DRRF6RJ","created_at":"2025-07-05T01:36:07.123Z","updated_at":"2025-07-05T01:36:07.123Z"},{"id":5374,"title":"Sunnyside Drop","description":"A short game I made for a 2-hour game jam that I've fixed up to be presentable.

If you faced any problems with the link of the bot on the website, just open the Telegram app or website and go to the @saifurl_bot user, which is my bot.\n\nDescription:\nIt's now just a telegram bot that depends on your API key for testing. You could use this public shared API key (for testing cases only) (run /justtest on the bot to get it too):\ne15ce2a23e54a4a9c24a93796feb7ad20cc334357269b0f7732ab1c526e7e9d4\nHowever, if you want to get your own, you should go to the main site at urls.saifdev.xyz and create an account, then verify your account from the profile page, and go to the developer page and ask for your apikey\n\nThe available commands:\n/start - Start the bot and register\n/menu - Show main menu\n/apikey - Manage your API keys\n/shorturl - Manage short URLs\n/urls - Alias for the shorturl command\n/setdomain - Set your preferred domain\n/help - Show help information\n/contact - Contact information\n/about - About this bot\n/todo - Setup guide for new users\n/justtest - Get test API key (SoM/Converge only)\n/ping - Test bot responsiveness\n\n\nStory behind the project:\nFrom the beginning of the summer vacation and I wanted to learn to build bots, especially for Telegram, since I felt that would be funny and even useful for me and my built services in the future. However, there wasn't any idea or encouragement to learn to do so soon, since I am working on other projects and wanted to complete the first. Until I found the Converge YSWS program, which is at http://converge.hackclub.com. This program is a program where you submit a bot for any platform and get prizes like any YSWS program. That was like the spark that made me start this project, and I am happy now. \nThere are plans to create more bots for my short URL service, but I think I should complete my other projects first. \n\nI used AI in:\nI was using GitHub Copilot in VS Code. Copilot helped me with its code completion feature in saving time, and it also created the readme file for me. I was asking him if I failed in any problems, and writing commit messages, and some of the devlog descriptions.

In this game, you either escape from the opponent or chase them down ‚Äî depending on the mode you choose. It‚Äôs built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designed to give a smooth and interactive experience with both single-player and two-player options. The concept is simple, but the execution brings a level of creativity and detail that makes it stand out.\n\nWhat makes this game special is the set of features it packs into a browser-based experience. First, there are two main game modes: Player vs Computer (PVC) and Player vs Player (PVP). In PVC mode, the AI intelligently chases the player using a real-time pathfinding approach, creating tension as the player tries to survive. The PVP mode, on the other hand, adds a competitive edge where both players control their own characters ‚Äî one with arrow keys, the other with WASD. This dual-mode setup makes the game replayable and engaging for different audiences.\n\nThe game arena itself is filled with obstacles that are randomly generated in each session. This means that no two matches are exactly alike, encouraging players to adapt their strategy every time. Power-ups appear throughout the arena, and collecting them temporarily increases a player's speed, adding a strategic layer to the chase. There‚Äôs also a win condition: in PVC mode, if the player survives for a set time, they win ‚Äî adding a clear goal beyond just running away. The overall design is polished, with colorful gradients, glowing effects, and responsive layout adjustments that make it look and feel professional on any screen.\n\nThe reason I created this game is because I‚Äôve always been a big fan of chase games and I‚Äôm passionate about game development. I want to build big, creative, and enjoyable games in the future, and this project is the beginning of that journey. Rather than diving straight into complex systems, I chose to start with a smaller project that still reflects my ideas and creativity. This Chase Game is a foundation ‚Äî a first step in a series of projects I‚Äôm planning to build and ship as part of my personal learning and creative growth.\n\nMore exciting games are coming soon. Each one will explore new mechanics, stories, and fun ways to play. This is just the beginning, and I‚Äôm excited to continue developing games that not only work ‚Äî but spark joy and imagination in the people who play them.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mande-lab/chase-game-/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://loquacious-druid-d6adf1.netlify.app/","repo_link":"https://github.com/mande-lab/chase-game-","slack_id":"U092JSPLANT","created_at":"2025-07-08T15:02:51.320Z","updated_at":"2025-07-18T20:48:57.877Z"},{"id":5836,"title":"Workshop","description":"An Idea that has been bouncing around in my head for the longest time.

It begins with a cinematic cutscene where thieves steal gold and cash from the player‚Äôs home. As the robbers escape in a black car, the player and their wife witness the scene and leap into their white sports car to chase them down. The game then transitions into a fast-paced highway pursuit, where the player must dodge traffic and obstacles while trying to catch the thieves. The goal is to speed up and crash into the back of the thief's car to win, but if the player crashes into any other object or car, the mission fails.\n\nWhat inspired me to make this game was discovering that 2.5D-style visuals ‚Äî which look almost 3D ‚Äî are actually possible to create using just HTML Canvas and some clever JavaScript. I had never realized such things could be built without a 3D engine. After seeing a video demonstrating this concept, I decided to bring it to life with my own original storyline, custom mechanics, and cinematic feel. What makes this game special is the integration of a story-driven setup, lane-based movement, and outcome-based endings ‚Äî all powered by pure front-end technologies. The scrolling background, lane switching, animated intro, win/loss conditions, and responsive controls make this both a creative and technically challenging project. It‚Äôs not just a game ‚Äî it‚Äôs the beginning of a series of story-rich, fast-paced experiences I plan to build.\n\n","category":null,"readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mande-lab/car-chase-game./refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://luxury-crumble-84a7f0.netlify.app/","repo_link":"https://github.com/mande-lab/car-chase-game.","slack_id":"U092JSPLANT","created_at":"2025-07-11T07:41:23.784Z","updated_at":"2025-07-18T17:09:49.867Z"},{"id":6168,"title":"Anime/Movie Bot","description":"This bot helps you to get recommendation of anime/movie based on genre and similarity","category":null,"readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbheemara/anime_movie_bot_pub/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://t.me/anime_movie_kb_bot","repo_link":"https://github.com/bbheemara/anime_movie_bot_pub","slack_id":"U093T9H2431","created_at":"2025-07-11T07:50:00.645Z","updated_at":"2025-07-19T03:12:57.801Z"},{"id":6169,"title":"Mood Reflect","description":"Mood Reflect is a simple, powerful app to track your emotions and boost mental wellness.

This strategy modifies the repulsive part of Van der Waals (VDW) and Hydrogen Bond (HB) potentials based on the coarseness of the rotamer library and specific atom types, allowing for greater tolerance in atomic contacts that arise from using discrete rotamer libraries.

(Balance buries a mountain...)\nA protagonist that is neither the hero nor represents you!\nExtremely inconsistent artstyle!:\nPixel Art! (Frame by Frame Animation)\nGreen Screen!\nTweening!\n3D models!\nAnd Ragdolls!\nWill scope freak destroy me? Most likely!\nGameplay: Players would go through a dungeon, doing battle (or fleeing) in a action-based combat system.\nGame engine: Godot 4.x\nExperience: I've worked on a few different games before, and I've played around with Godot for a few months now. I'm fairly comfortable with the engine, and I could definitely lend a hand to any beginners here. :)\nOther notes: I'd like to also write some other games giving this one some inspiration:\nEnter The Gungeon\nNobody Saves The World\nDemonTower (from Night in the Woods)\nHyper Light Drifter\nThe Legend of Zelda (the original from the 1900s + Link's Awakening)\nRogue (The original one)","category":null,"readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U091N2WLQ1K","created_at":"2025-07-15T00:18:41.912Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T00:18:59.945Z"},{"id":6652,"title":"ShareX Manager","description":"A simple way to manage and share ShareX media, with a nice dashboard!","category":null,"readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdiamonddog/sharex-manager/master/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/mrdiamonddog/sharex-manager","slack_id":"U091MNGNRA9","created_at":"2025-07-15T00:25:06.747Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T00:25:55.788Z"},{"id":6653,"title":"Advice Generator","description":"It fetches an advice API and shows it to you.","category":null,"readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luiggircardoso/advice-generator/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://luiggircardoso.github.io/advice-generator","repo_link":"https://github.com/luiggircardoso/advice-generator","slack_id":"U092D1U466L","created_at":"2025-07-15T01:48:07.689Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T01:48:07.689Z"},{"id":6654,"title":"Solvr","description":"e","category":null,"readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U078XLAFNMQ","created_at":"2025-07-15T02:16:14.504Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T02:16:14.504Z"},{"id":6655,"title":"Rizzlingo","description":"text here","category":null,"readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U078XLAFNMQ","created_at":"2025-07-15T02:17:19.275Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T02:17:19.275Z"},{"id":6656,"title":"Wakatime Fusion 360 Interconnect","description":"A Fusion 360 plugin for wakaTime","category":null,"readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Dreadrook/fusion360_wakatime_plugin","slack_id":"U08A073MD40","created_at":"2025-07-15T02:18:39.553Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T02:18:39.553Z"},{"id":6657,"title":"Skooty -

Whether it‚Äôs searching for formulas, trying to remember unit conversions, or simply needing clear concept notes, the stress before an exam can feel overwhelming. That‚Äôs why I created this website: to bring everything a high school student needs into one easy, accessible, and engaging platform.\n\nUnlike many generic math sites, this platform is built with the student‚Äôs real experience in mind. It combines a vibrant and modern design with essential study tools. From quick-access math formulas, unit converters, and concept notes (that also include their history, real-life applications, and career relevance) to a fun and challenging quiz section‚Äîeverything is tailored to make math feel less like a chore and more like an enjoyable journey.\n\nThe site also introduces a smart test prep section focused on exams like the SAT, providing structured practice to help students feel more confident before the big day. A big part of the redesign includes a new advanced quiz system that generates five fresh questions on every attempt, gives instant feedback with red and green highlights, and offers personalized scoring comments. It‚Äôs not just a quiz‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience that guides you as you learn.\n\nDesign-wise, the interface uses a vibrant purple and teal color scheme with smooth gradient backgrounds, subtle animations, and lively hover effects, all aimed at making studying visually enjoyable. A fully functional night/day mode now works seamlessly, respecting your system preferences and keeping the setting across sessions. Navigation is also smoother, with support for direct section links and elegant transitions throughout.\n\nIn short, this website is more than just a study tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a supportive space built for students, by a student, to make math learning fast, focused, and fun.","category":null,"readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mande-lab/math-supporter/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://willowy-salamander-45268f.netlify.app/#home-page","repo_link":"https://github.com/mande-lab/math-supporter","slack_id":"U092JSPLANT","created_at":"2025-07-15T12:59:40.912Z","updated_at":"2025-07-20T13:34:40.047Z"},{"id":6702,"title":"Radar","description":"A cool game in Godot where you can't see your enemies but you hear them!","category":null,"readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NachuT/Radar/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/NachuT/Radar","slack_id":"U07NK0WQNSU","created_at":"2025-07-15T13:23:24.162Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T19:48:14.490Z"},{"id":6703,"title":"Echoes of Eternity","description":"Survive an AI-generated world: Infinite enemy designs, randomized loot, and ever-shifting challenges","category":null,"readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/PixelCode01/Echoes-of-Eternity","slack_id":"U091JCTGUDV","created_at":"2025-07-15T13:24:18.813Z","updated_at":"2025-07-15T13:24:18.813Z"},{"id":6704,"title":"Beyblade","description":"A game with spinning tops","category":null,"readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U07D01SEFFV","created_at":"2025-07-15T13:29:12.427Z","updated_at":"2025-07-16T17:55:10.194Z"},{"id":6705,"title":"The Terminal News","description":"NYT news feed with a cool twist.

I realized I wasn‚Äôt alone; many students, like me, get overwhelmed by a growing list of tasks and exam dates. That‚Äôs when I decided to create something practical‚Äînot just for myself but for anyone who finds it hard to manage their academic responsibilities. The idea was simple: build a tool that makes planning easy, visual, and even fun.\n\nWhat sets this project apart is its combination of intelligent features and a visually rich experience. It‚Äôs more than a to-do list‚Äîit‚Äôs a smart assistant for students. Users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks, mark exams, and assign priority levels. Due dates are automatically color-coded for better awareness, while animated pie charts and bar graphs break down your workload in a visual and interactive way. Real-time stats, alerts for urgent deadlines, and a PDF export option make it not just helpful, but truly powerful for staying on track.\n\nVisually, the site embraces a vibrant sunset-themed UI with animated gradients, floating particles, and glowing effects that create an immersive feel.

It‚Äôs set on a stylish curved track viewed in a 2.5D perspective, and speed boosters placed along the road give sudden bursts of acceleration, making the race intense and strategic. A countdown and lap system keep the gameplay structured and engaging.\n\nWhat makes this game stand out is its rich visual design and immersive environment. Realistic moving clouds glide across the sky, while glamorous buildings surround the race track, adding a vibrant city-like atmosphere that brings the world to life. These background elements create a sense of speed, depth, and excitement throughout the race. The player‚Äôs car is drawn using the same rendering method as AI cars, ensuring smooth, consistent movement, especially at the finish line.
