For advanced use cases, a jailbroken or rooted device is recommended.\n\nAn official installer, portable version, and Homebrew tap are in development.

This deeply inspired me to create a solution that could empower them with the right information at the right time. I’ve always been passionate about technology and artificial intelligence, and I wanted to apply these tools to solve real-world problems.\n\nThe idea of combining AI with agriculture came from observing how data-driven systems are transforming industries, while agriculture still faces huge gaps in access to information. I realized that even small changes—like recommending the right crop or identifying pests early—could have a big impact on a farmer’s income and food security. That’s what motivated me to build this AI-based platform: to support farmers, reduce resource waste, and make agriculture smarter and more sustainable.\n\nWhat it does\nThis project is an AI-powered farming assistant that helps farmers make smart, data-driven decisions to increase productivity and reduce waste. Based on inputs like weather, soil type, pH, NPKC levels, and farm size, it performs the following key functions:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crop using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), based on soil and environmental conditions.\n\nIrrigation \u0026 Water Prediction: Uses ANN to recommend the best irrigation method and estimate the right amount of water needed.\n\nYield Prediction: Predicts potential crop yield using ANN, helping farmers plan better.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: Uses a Random Forest model to recommend the correct type of fertilizer based on nutrient levels and crop type.\n\nFertilizer \u0026 Pesticide Quantity Estimation: An ANN model calculates the exact amount of fertilizer and pesticide needed, avoiding overuse and reducing costs.\n\nThe platform uses a Next.js frontend for user interaction and a FastAPI backend to process the inputs and return AI-generated recommendations. It aims to make farming more precise, efficient, and accessible for all.\n\nHow we built it\nWe built this project using a modern and scalable tech stack, combining machine learning models with a full-stack web application.\n\nFrontend: We used Next.js to build a responsive and interactive frontend that allows farmers to input data such as soil type, pH, NPKC levels, weather details, and farm size. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and mobile-compatible for easy access.\n\nBackend: The backend is powered by FastAPI, a fast and efficient Python web framework. It handles incoming requests, processes data, communicates with the machine learning models, and returns predictions to the frontend.\n\nMachine Learning Models:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze environmental and soil parameters.\n\nIrrigation and Water Requirement: An ANN predicts the most suitable irrigation method and how much water the crop will need.\n\nYield Prediction: Another ANN model estimates the potential yield based on input factors.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: A Random Forest classifier determines the best fertilizer based on soil nutrients and crop type.\n\nFertilizer \u0026 Pesticide Quantity: An ANN model calculates precise quantities required to avoid overuse.\n\nTraining \u0026 Data: We trained our models using agricultural datasets containing soil, weather, and crop data. Each model was evaluated and fine-tuned to improve accuracy and generalization.\n\nAll components are integrated seamlessly, ensuring that users get real-time, reliable insights through a web-based interface.\n\nChallenges we ran into\nBuilding this AI-powered farming assistant as a solo developer was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I encountered several obstacles throughout the development process:\n\nData Collection \u0026 Cleaning: Finding accurate, real-world agricultural datasets was difficult. I had to combine multiple sources and spend time cleaning, organizing, and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for model training.\n\nChoosing the Right Models: Selecting the best algorithms for different tasks required experimentation. I tried various models before finalizing ANN for crop prediction, water estimation, and yield prediction, and Random Forest for fertilizer recommendations. Fine-tuning them to get good accuracy without overfitting took time.\n\nFeature Selection: Understanding which input features (like pH, NPKC, farm size, etc.) were most relevant for each prediction task was a major challenge. I had to study agricultural practices and test combinations to get meaningful outputs.\n\nFrontend-Backend Integration: Connecting the Next.js frontend with the FastAPI backend was tricky. I ran into CORS issues and had to carefully manage API routing and request handling to make the data flow smooth and responsive.\n\nBalancing Accuracy \u0026 Simplicity: While aiming for high model accuracy, I also had to ensure the system remained simple enough for farmers to use. It was tough to design a system that’s both powerful and practical.\n\nDesigning a User-Friendly Interface: I had to make the UI intuitive, clean, and usable even on mobile devices, keeping in mind that many users may not be tech-savvy. Creating a smooth user experience took multiple design iterations.\n\nWorking alone pushed me to learn, adapt, and solve problems independently, and this experience helped me grow both technically and personally.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nBuilt a Complete AI Solution from Scratch: I successfully designed and developed an end-to-end AI system that predicts crops, irrigation needs, fertilizer types, and yield using real agricultural data.\n\nIntegrated Full Stack Technologies: I built a fully functional frontend using Next.js and connected it seamlessly to a FastAPI backend, managing both UI design and backend logic on my own.\n\nTrained Multiple ML Models: I implemented and trained multiple machine learning models (ANN and Random Forest) tailored for specific agricultural predictions, achieving good accuracy and real-world usability.\n\nDesigned a Clean, Usable Interface: I created a user-friendly web interface that’s responsive and accessible, ensuring ease of use even for farmers with limited technical knowledge.\n\nLearned \u0026 Applied Real-World Problem Solving: I tackled real-world issues like data inconsistency, model selection, and feature engineering, and found effective solutions through research and persistence.\n\nStayed Consistent \u0026 Self-Motivated: As a solo developer, I’m proud that I stayed committed, organized, and motivated through each phase—from planning and coding to testing and deployment.\n\nWhat we learned\nThroughout this project, I gained valuable experience and technical skills across multiple areas:\n\nApplied Machine Learning in Agriculture: I learned how to train and evaluate ML models like ANN and Random Forest for real-world agricultural use cases, including crop prediction, yield estimation, and fertilizer recommendations.\n\nFull-Stack Development: I improved my skills in both frontend and backend development using Next.js and FastAPI, learning how to integrate APIs, manage state, and build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.\n\nData Handling \u0026 Preprocessing: I learned the importance of clean, relevant data. I developed skills in data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare datasets for model training.\n\nModel Optimization \u0026 Evaluation: I gained hands-on experience in tuning hyperparameters, avoiding overfitting, and improving model accuracy and generalization.\n\nProblem-Solving \u0026 Debugging: I faced many technical challenges, especially in backend integration and model deployment, which taught me to troubleshoot issues methodically and stay persistent.\n\nUser-Centric Thinking: Designing an interface with farmers in mind taught me the value of simplicity and accessibility in tech solutions.\n\nThis project gave me the confidence to build practical AI tools and showed me how technology can make a real difference in critical fields like agriculture.\n\nWhat's next for FarmAI\nFarmAI is already live and deployed at farmai-nine.vercel.app(since its backend is hosted on Render's free tier its backend works slow sometimes), providing farmers with AI-powered recommendations. But this is just the beginning. Here's what's next for FarmAI:\n\nFrontend Enhancements \u0026 New Features: Continue improving the user interface for a better user experience, adding new functionalities, and optimizing the app for faster loading times.\n\nMultilingual Support: Add support for regional languages to make the platform more accessible to farmers from different areas, especially those in rural regions.\n\nIntegration with Real-Time APIs: Incorporate real-time weather and soil data APIs to provide more accurate predictions based on live environmental conditions.\n\nDatabase Expansion: Add more crop varieties, soil types, and fertilizer profiles to ensure the system caters to a broader set of geographical areas and farming needs.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"https://youtu.be/GV4v6cYUlmA?si=HHQWzP0Hty7TgCok","repo_link":"https://github.com/sidjain1239/farmai-frontend","slack_id":"U091RQ4BPEH","created_at":"2025-06-17T10:42:42.005Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T10:50:25.607Z"},{"id":4406,"title":"Lifelinee","description":"A simple dashboard to help with assignments","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U07TSJW9F33","created_at":"2025-06-29T20:27:25.231Z","updated_at":"2025-06-29T20:27:25.231Z"},{"id":2603,"title":"Portfolio Website ","description":"HTML, CSS, JavaScript\nThis project is a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, experiences, and contact information.

To fix it, I built TechnikTeam, a custom web platform that acts as the single source of truth for all our operations. It's a full-stack Java application designed to bring order and professionalism to our student-run events.\n\n🚀 Core Features:\n\nEvent Scheduling \u0026 Crewing: Plan events, define roles (like \"sound tech\"), and assign crew members based on their skills.\nLive Event Dashboard: During a show, assigned members get a real-time dashboard with a group chat and a shared task list to stay in sync.\nQR-Powered Inventory: Catalog all our gear. Anyone can scan a QR code on a piece of equipment to see what it is and where it belongs, and crew members can check items in or out.\nInteractive Skills Matrix: A huge grid that visually tracks which crew members are trained on which equipment, making it easy to find the right person for the job.\nRole-Based Access: A full admin panel for leaders and a streamlined view for student crew members.\nTech Stack\nJava (Servlets/JSP), MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Apache Tomcat.\n\nWhat I Learned\nFull-Stack Development: I built the entire system myself, from designing the relational database schema in MySQL to coding the backend logic in Java and building the dynamic frontend with JSP and JavaScript.\nSolving a Real Problem: This wasn't a tutorial. I had to talk to my crew, understand their pain points, and design features that actually made their lives easier.\nComplex Systems Design: I learned how to architect interconnected features, like making the inventory reservations appear on the event pages and building the complex data queries needed for the interactive skills matrix.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Imjack1-cyber/TechnikTeam","slack_id":"U091MUWD64V","created_at":"2025-06-16T20:22:16.243Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T06:34:32.934Z"},{"id":3701,"title":"Chess","description":"simple chess website","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U083H4U954G","created_at":"2025-06-25T13:35:11.735Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T13:35:11.735Z"},{"id":3505,"title":"Sprigcraft","description":"A 2d minecraft clone for sprig","category":"Video Game","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/MiniKielbyM/LockBox","slack_id":"U0925ST8U4B","created_at":"2025-06-24T18:03:42.604Z","updated_at":"2025-06-26T12:47:56.198Z"},{"id":2010,"title":"Document and Handwriting Digitizer","description":"A simple, clean and intuitive scanner to convert physical documents to a pdf format.

By focusing on shared academic interests, extracurricular activities and personal values, we help students cut through the noise of generic social networks.\n\nImpact and Vision:\nCampusConnect represents a new approach to student socialization - one that values quality connections over quantity.

At its core is the Achernar Daemon, a headless service written in Rust and C++ that runs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson, or field laptops. This daemon handles camera interfacing (via V4L2 or ASI SDK), real-time frame capture, debayering, and hardware encoding, with integrated ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for on-device inference. It runs a local REST API (via actix-web or warp) to expose control interfaces.\n\nThe AI layer performs offline inference to suggest focus, exposure, and filter settings based on local environmental conditions, using quantized ONNX models that are confidence-based and never enforced. Imaging sessions are organized in a local-first folder structure, saving FITS files, logs, and preview videos, with append-only JSON logs and optional SQLite used for dashboard caching. When internet becomes available, sessions can be automatically synced to S3, Google Drive, or Dropbox via rclone or custom Rust logic.\n\nUsers interact through either a WebApp PWA, designed with React or SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS, or a Desktop App for advanced control. The WebApp is served from the edge device over a local Wi-Fi hotspot, enabling users to preview live streams (MJPEG or WebRTC), pick targets, and start imaging directly from their phone or tablet. The Desktop App—built using Qt or Tauri—caters to professionals with tools for FITS inspection, focus metric plotting, and full mount control (via INDI or ASCOM). All user sessions are secure, crash-safe, and never rely on cloud services for imaging, making Achernar robust for remote or off-grid astronomy. Cloud sync and remote dashboards activate only post-session, ensuring reliability with WebSockets for control and WebRTC tunnels for live previews, hosted optionally via Next.js or SvelteKit on platforms like Vercel.\n\nAlso, beacause im like activley working on this, i only have the github, im working on the readme and the demo link tho, i want to get an mvp done by like julys

Whether you’re trying to figure out why your battery drains so fast or just want better info while charging, WattUp has your back.\nHere’s what it can do:\n\n    Track battery usage over time with clean, interactive graphs\n\n    Show your battery health, including wear level and original vs current capacity\n\n    Give you charging and discharging estimates based on real usage, not guesswork\n\n    Show detailed battery stats like cycle count, voltage, temperature, and more\n\n    Run quietly in the background without eating up your system resources\n\nIt’s everything the Windows battery meter should’ve been, but isn’t.\n\nIf you care about your battery and want better control over how your device uses power, WattUp makes it easy.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U091SEHGETW","created_at":"2025-06-19T03:25:15.822Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T03:25:15.822Z"},{"id":1645,"title":"Cadet","description":"A platform focused around comp programming.

Everyone receives a secret word except for the Impostor. Now, everyone has to say a word. The crewmates have to say a word which tells the other crewmates that they themselves are not the Impostor, and the Impostor tries to mislead them into thinking that person isn't the Impostor. After a few rounds, everyone votes for one player they think is the Impostor. If they get it right, they win; if not, the Impostor wins.\n\nExample: The word is beach\n\nCrewmate1 says: Cocktail (because of beach bar and such things)\nCrewmate2 says: Castle (because of building a sandcastle)\nImpostor1 says: Sun ( because the Imposter understood that the word may be sth about vacation/beach or sth like that)\n\nCurrently, many students, like myself, are playing at school in free time and, for example, in breaks.\n\nThere are many apps being used, but I thought about the people who don't have many friends to play with because there maybe want to play the game too but cant ( xD )  . That's why I want to work on an app where you can play it yourself with AI friends.\n\nI know it sounds like a troll project, and yeah, it was a random thought I had at school, but I kind of liked it. That's why I am programming it.\n\nMy goal is to make an Android \u0026 iOS compatible app where you can just play the Impostor game with a few AI Agents.\n\nI also chose this project because normally I mainly write Python or Java backend code, and I want to challenge myself to program some React Native.","category":"Mobile App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockplacer4/ImposterGameWithAI/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/blockplacer4/ImposterGameWithAI","slack_id":"U091Q6XL5R8","created_at":"2025-06-19T20:29:09.005Z","updated_at":"2025-06-28T22:22:33.369Z"},{"id":4280,"title":"Wave Rider","description":"A game deeply inspired by the Chrome Dino game.\n","category":"Video Game","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U07D01SEFFV","created_at":"2025-06-28T20:27:04.972Z","updated_at":"2025-07-02T23:51:00.810Z"},{"id":3839,"title":"Blackjack","description":"Simple blackjack (only hits and stands) in cli with simulator to test strategies to win\n","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/imaegg11/Blackjack","slack_id":"U07AFA2J3EY","created_at":"2025-06-26T04:05:25.852Z","updated_at":"2025-06-27T04:23:21.277Z"},{"id":130,"title":"libsim","description":"a platform for book readers to find new friends and share their favorite works with each other. i wanted to create an application where i could save all of my manga and web novels in one space :)","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vempr/libsim/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/vempr/libsim","slack_id":"U09222ZKR7T","created_at":"2025-06-16T18:15:06.100Z","updated_at":"2025-06-27T20:01:36.362Z"},{"id":632,"title":"Keplerian Orbit Simulator","description":"A Keplerian orbit simulator library.

MindPilot was born from this personal frustration, a tool that combines a smart focus assistant with an intelligent tutor, all in a lightweight and accessible web app.\n\nMindPilot allows you to start distraction-free focus sessions using a timer-based system while keeping track of your progress. But what makes it unique is the ability to ask any question or type any topic, and the built-in AI (powered by Cohere’s Command R+ model) explains it in a clear and understandable way. Whether you're struggling with a math concept, a programming topic, or even a piece of history, MindPilot is here to help.\n\nThe project is built using React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. It connects to the Cohere API to generate explanations in real time. A .env system is used to keep API keys safe, and the frontend and backend communicate through REST endpoints.\n\nThroughout the Summer of Making, I plan to extend MindPilot with new features such as:\n\nA personal progress dashboard\nSupport for multiple subjects and languages\nEnhanced session analytics\nAnd eventually, a mobile app version\nThe goal is to turn MindPilot into something that doesn't just help me but could help any student, self-learner, or curious mind around the world.

Vendors can sign up easily, manage inventory, and handle orders through a simple interface without any technical expertise. Payments are processed securely through UPI and cards, and deliveries are managed via store-based coordination or local delivery partners.\n\nThis project is my attempt to democratize access to quick-commerce infrastructure by giving real-world stores the same digital capabilities as corporate chains — without needing to own a warehouse or a private delivery fleet.

My project is called BKFZ SubGHz (stands for Brian's Knockoff Flipper Zero, lol), a custom-built ESP32 device that can scan, record, and replay SubGHz radio signals, kind of like a DIY version of the Flipper Zero!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI built this last October after getting curious about how the Flipper Zero works, and wanted to recreate part of its functionality using cheap AliExpress parts. What started as a small side project I worked on when I was free quickly turned into one of the most challenging projects I’ve ever made. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe project is powered by an ESP32 (a Wi-Fi microcontroller that runs all the code) which serves a web interface you can access from your phone. The microcontroller is connected to a CC1101 transceiver, which is a chip capable of capturing and replaying SubGHz frequencies like 433 MHz (the Flipper Zero uses this exact same chip from Texas Instruments).\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe entire thing is held together by a custom PCB designed in KiCad to keep it small, and it has added support for .sub files from real Flipper Zeros (so it’s compatible with public files from the flipper community). I also added support for preset modulation to match the Flipper Zero's configuration!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFeatures:\n- Frequency Analyzer: Scan and analyze nearby devices and their frequencies with ease.\n- Record RAW: Capture and record nearby signals with precise RSSI configuration.\n- Replay RAW: Replay previously captured signals from a file (no SD card required).\n- Preset Configuration: Configure the frequency of your device, and set the preset modulation (just like the Flipper Zero!).\n- Flipper Zero Support: Effortlessly replay any Flipper Zero SUB file, including the many publicly available ones, whenever you need.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe following parts were used for the project (~$18.01 total, but you can make a minimal USB-powered one for ~$4.98)\n\u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz/refs/heads/main/Other/Assembly%20Photos/Components/All%20Components.jpeg\" /\u003e","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz","repo_link":"https://github.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz","slack_id":"U091MEESEDT","created_at":"2025-06-18T22:27:05.593Z","updated_at":"2025-06-27T05:45:32.221Z"},{"id":1648,"title":"Voltify","description":"Voltify is your ultimate destination for high-quality electronics at unbeatable prices.

Modern hardware outperforms this approach for general cases of multiplication due to extreme optimization of traditional arithmetic. The key bottleneck is factorization latency (why RSA works). Today, it’s not viable for multiplication, but one can easily figure out the most efficient cases for it and combine the binary GCD algorithm with the PFS (Prime Factor System) algorithm and then we get an optimized version of the binary GCD and LCM algorithms (the second one is heavily based on GCD).\nFuture quantum integration could revolutionize multiplication too:\nShor’s algorithm would enable efficient factorization\nPractical for huge numbers (n \u003e 2^25 bits based on my calculations)\nTurns prime vectors into an universal accelerator for many operations","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xCuzImVinni/Prime-Vectors/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/xCuzImVinni/Prime-Vectors/releases/tag/Algorithm","repo_link":"https://github.com/xCuzImVinni/Prime-Vectors","slack_id":"U092HKP1D3L","created_at":"2025-06-22T15:43:09.224Z","updated_at":"2025-07-02T01:56:35.438Z"},{"id":3005,"title":"F-Shiping","description":"F-shipping is a blog-style e-commerce web app designed for simple dropshipping.

Each prime number corresponds to an axis arranged radially in a circle, and a number's prime exponents determine its coordinates along these axes. Stacking these polygons vertically represents multiple numbers, creating a 3D prime-factor geometry. This novel visualization aids intuitive understanding of prime factorization structures and explores new geometric insights in number theory. It combines algebraic concepts with interactive 3D graphics for educational and research applications.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xCuzImVinni/GeoPrimes/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/xCuzImVinni/GeoPrimes","slack_id":"U092HKP1D3L","created_at":"2025-07-01T11:14:44.840Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T11:19:50.811Z"},{"id":3742,"title":"Cosmic Defender","description":"Built With 🧑‍💻\nThis game is built entirely with pure JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS3, without any outside dependencies or libraries.

My project features a bot for Discord communities to create detailed timers, alarms, and reminders in their Discord server. This project is very special to me because it was actually my very first coding project back in 2020! A project so small also happened to be the project that helped me discover my true passion for coding, and helped me start my journey with Node.js development. For years now, Discord has lacked a native way to create timers, alarms, and reminders in Discord servers (a rather simple feature that many large communities have asked for). This bot is my attempt to finally solve that problem once and for all!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started developing this bot back in middle school, but over time, it became too overwhelming with the constant changes to Discord's API. With factors outside of my reach like rising server costs and busy study nights throughout the week, I eventually decided to shut down the project. Well, my goal this week is to try and bring it back to life, and rebuild the entire thing from the ground up!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI'll be honest, being my first ever coding project, Timer Bot was definitely the sloppiest code I've ever written (nowhere near being production-ready).

It validates these recommendations against organizational policies enforced by OPA, ensuring compliant and optimized group assignments.\n\nThe solution includes:\n1. A React-based Frontend for user selection and result visualization.\n2. A FastAPI-based Backend to handle agent requests and serve the LangGraph engine.\n3. An Okta API Integration Layer for real-time user and group data retrieval.\n4. An OPA Policy Evaluation Layer to block non-compliant group assignments.\n5. Real-time logs for step-by-step traceability.\nThis project streamlines identity governance, enhances security posture, and provides an interactive interface for role analysis and decision-making.\n\nWrapper Layer: Orchestrating the System\nThe Wrapper Layer acts as the central orchestration engine that connects the frontend, backend, LangGraph agent, Okta APIs, and the OPA policy engine in a seamless flow. It provides a unified API interface that simplifies interactions across these distributed components.\n\nKey functions of the Wrapper Layer:\n1. Data Aggregation:\nCollects user and group information from the Okta API and serves it in a cleaned, frontend-friendly format.\n2. Process Invocation:\nSends user data to the LangGraph agent for group suggestion and orchestrates the complete flow from input selection to final decision.\n3. Response Routing:\nHandles asynchronous processing and real-time log streaming to the frontend, ensuring users can track every step of the decision process live.\n4. Abstraction:\nDecouples the complex backend logic from the React frontend, providing clean and minimal APIs for easy consumption.\n5.

For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1 could represent white.\n\nIn this sense, then, is an image just a bitmap (i.e., a map of bits). For more colorful images, you simply need more bits per pixel. A file format (like BMP, JPEG, or PNG) that supports “24-bit color” uses 24 bits per pixel. (BMP actually supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color.)\n\nA 24-bit BMP uses 8 bits to signify the amount of red in a pixel’s color, 8 bits to signify the amount of green in a pixel’s color, and 8 bits to signify the amount of blue in a pixel’s color. If you’ve ever heard of RGB color, well, there you have it: red, green, blue.\n\nIf the R, G, and B values of some pixel in a BMP are, say, 0xff, 0x00, and 0x00 in hexadecimal, that pixel is purely red, as 0xff (otherwise known as 255 in decimal) implies “a lot of red,” while 0x00 and 0x00 imply “no green” and “no blue,” respectively.

To solve this issue, AP Study Tool uses an aesthetic pink UI theme to ensure that students do not get distracted by a boring old UI when studying for their AP exams. The web app explains big ideas, includes helpful resources, and may even have an AI helper in the future! Although it doesn't have EVERY single AP exam on it, the website offers resources for the most popular AP exams available.

They're all surface-level. Generic symptom checkers with scripted flows that rarely understand real clinical pathways.\n\nWhat I built goes deeper.\n\nThis is an intelligent oncology triage system designed with clinical logic at its core. Instead of vague symptom matching, it uses structured decision pathways tailored to cancer screening protocols — streamlining the pre-diagnosis process with precision. It doesn’t just save time; it meaningfully reduces the load on oncologists by guiding patients toward the right tests, or away from unnecessary ones, before they ever enter the clinic. The system is built to simulate a structured pre-consultation, mirroring the logic a specialist would follow, but without taking up clinical time.\n\nThe AI agent follows a decision-tree logic model designed in alignment with oncology screening guidelines and based on the patient’s responses, it recommends appropriate screening tests (e.g. mammogram, colonoscopy, bloodwork) or flags the case for urgent follow-up.\n\nI'm not just building a prototype or a \"student project\".
