Inspired by headless, extensible monitoring tools, offering a complete solution for educational and experimental use ([github.com][1]).\n\n---\n\n### üìå Why NetScout‚ÄëPi?\n\nThe Raspberry‚ÄØPi makes a fantastic platform for learning networking fundamentals‚Äîbut configuring tools piecemeal (e.g. iperf3, tcpdump, traceroute) can be tedious and fragmented. NetScout‚ÄëPi bundles these core utilities into a single interface, enabling:\n\n* Simultaneous diagnostic workflows\n* Modular extensibility via plugins\n* REST \u0026 WebSocket access\n* Responsiveness on mobile and desktop devices\n\n---\n\n### üéØ Key Features in v1.0\n\n* **Web Dashboard** with responsive UI showcasing real-time metrics\n* **Live Interface Monitoring**: IP, MAC, packet counters, link status\n* **Modular Plugin System**: Add new diagnostics via Go, Python, or Bash scripts\n* Organized **Accordion Menu** by functionality\n* **REST API** for automation, plus WebSocket real-time updates\n* **External Plugin Support**, so users can tailor the tool to their environment\n\n---\n\n### üß∞ Core Tools \u0026 Plugins\n\n#### Network Analysis\n\n* **Interface Info**\n* **Bandwidth Test** via iPerf3\n* **QoS Simulation** (traffic control)\n* **MTU Discovery** with ping sweeps\n* **Packet Capture** via tcpdump\n\n#### Connectivity\n\n* **Ping** and **Traceroute**\n\n#### Discovery\n\n* **Port Scanner**, **LAN Device Discovery**, **Wi‚ÄëFi Scanner**\n\n#### DNS\n\n* **DNS Lookup**, **Propagation Checker**, **Reverse Lookup**\n\n#### Security\n\n* **SSL/TLS Checker**\n\n---\n\n### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Build \u0026 Run\n\n1. **Clone \u0026 build** with Go¬†1.16+\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/raf181/NetScout-Pi.git\n   cd NetScout-Pi\n   go build\n   ```\n\n   \u003e *Tip for Pi Zero 2W users*: add `CGO_ENABLED=0` if you encounter build issues.\n\n2. **Run** locally:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./netscout-pi --port=8080\n   ```\n\n3. **Visit** `http://\u003cpi-ip\u003e:8080` from any browser.\n\n4. **Optional: run as a service** with a systemd unit for auto startup.\n\n---\n\n### üß© Plugin System Highlights\n\nProjects are only as powerful as their plugins. Key features include:\n\n* **Metadata-driven**: each plugin has a `plugin.json` for name, category, parameters\n* **Decoupled execution**: Go/Cli/persistent processes\n* **Categorization**: easy navigation via accordion UI\n* **API access**: `GET /api/plugins`, `POST /api/plugins/\u003cid\u003e/run`\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://\u003cpi-ip\u003e:8080/api/plugins/ping/run \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"host\":\"example.com\",\"count\":4}'\n```\n\nReturns structured JSON with result details.\n\n---\n\n### ‚ö° Web \u0026 Real-Time Features\n\n* **RESTful endpoints** for all tools\n* **WebSockets** providing continuous updates (e.g., real-time network stats)\n* **Mobile-first design** in the user interface\n\n---\n\n### üõ† Known Issues \u0026 Roadmap\n\n**Warning: v1.0 is beta-grade. Not production-ready.**\n\n* Some plugins (like QoS or MTU tester) need better error handling and permissions\n* Packet capture may need sudo or root access\n* **Next milestones**:\n\n  * Authentication \u0026 ACLs\n  * Secure HTTPS support\n  * Expanded plugin library (SSL cert, DNS, SNMP)\n  * Enhanced UX: plugin search, dynamic config\n  * Metrics logging+visualizations\n\n---\n\n### üõ° Security \u0026 Performance\n\n* No auth or TLS in v1.0 ‚Äî please use it only in trusted/enclosed environments\n* Plugin execution is synchronous and blocking; expect delays with long-running tools\n* Future support planned for asynchronous, rate-limited operations\n\n---\n\n### üßë‚Äçüéì Contribute \u0026 Develop\n\nWant to help?\n\n1. **Fork** the repo\n2. Create a feature branch\n3. **Craft plugins** following `app/plugins/DEVELOPMENT.md`\n4. Submit a **PR** ‚Äî documentation, code clarity, tests much appreciated\n\n---\n\n### üìÑ License \u0026 Acknowledgments\n\nLicensed under MIT.

Well, I was looking around my unfinished projects directory when I came across this project from a couple years ago. I wanted to give it a shot at finishing it, or at least polishing it up a bit. \r\n\r\nThe general idea of how this program works is a bit counterintuitive. While most fire simulations represent heat as things that rise, and so pixels tend to set pixels higher than them. This simulation does the reverse. Each pixel looks at pixels below it in order to determine its heat value. This also has the unintended (but not unwelcome) side effect of making the bottom row of pixels always keep its heat value, as they do not have pixels below them to look up their new heat values, so the \"ground\" is \"flammable\". The X coordinate is also warped by a random amount, plus some scrolling perlin noise for added variety with coherence. The \"sparks\" at the tops of the flames are emergent behavior, there is no part of the code that intentionally creates those.\r\n\r\nWhy Python? Well, it's what I know best. Additionally, I'd recently discovered [Taichi](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/), a domain specific, high performance, parallel language that is embedded within, and uses the semantics of, Python. Taichi allows me to run the fire simulation at a solid 60fps, and I've gotten it to run at 120 FPS at 1440x960 before being bottlenecked. At 640x480, it runs at a blazing (ha) fast 500 fps. None of these are precise benchmarks, and YMMV.\r\n\r\nI use PySide6 for the GUI, as my machine uses Plasma for the Desktop Environment, so it just made sense to write something for QT. Also, I know the library reasonably well. \r\nWhile this project is not intended to be a realistic fire simulation, it does have an excellent stylized fire look to it.","id":1973,"attachment":null,"project_id":1118,"slack_id":"U0923CX9XL1","created_at":"2025-06-19T22:34:58.315Z","updated_at":"2025-06-20T06:24:44.679Z"},{"text":"Made a header and also did some CSS","id":2037,"attachment":null,"project_id":1998,"slack_id":"U07AC69SX1A","created_at":"2025-06-20T01:33:02.081Z","updated_at":"2025-06-20T09:14:26.971Z"},{"text":"Added Backlights and I am working on a way to change the color of the car in game","id":2292,"attachment":null,"project_id":2143,"slack_id":"U091GR6129Z","created_at":"2025-06-20T14:06:46.385Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T03:43:11.634Z"},{"text":"added a news page, where you can comment on the posts","id":2353,"attachment":null,"project_id":1964,"slack_id":"U091SM4MWG5","created_at":"2025-06-20T16:26:56.699Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T06:16:54.523Z"},{"text":"Enhanced functionality and interactions","id":2312,"attachment":null,"project_id":1658,"slack_id":"U090R40303U","created_at":"2025-06-20T14:59:23.389Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T04:46:09.959Z"},{"text":"‚ôüÔ∏è Quirky Chess Engine - v0.1 ‚ôüÔ∏è\r\nüè° Added a Home Page!\r\nüåô Added Dark Mode support for the Home Page!","id":113,"attachment":null,"project_id":231,"slack_id":"U088Z65TDRN","created_at":"2025-06-16T21:56:18.694Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T19:22:01.127Z"},{"text":"Created a very simple theme testing page with support for light as well as dark mode, based on the system preference.

Welcome to this project's first devlog! Well actually, this really isn't a 'devlog' more than it's a previously on segment, but it's the thought that counts. So first things first: This is a preexisting project (by like a monthish). As such, there's already a ton of progress made to it from before I joined this summer codeathon thing. So let me catch you up:\r\n\r\nEssentially, this is a hobby project that I'm turning into a library for a friend. You see, over the years, my friend has made a GIANT quotebook that contains a bunch of out-of-context quotes that they made throughout their school life. As a fun end-of-year activity, they asked me to make a program that automatically converts quotes in said quotebook into Kahoot questions that have them guess who made each quote. Sound easy, right? Well, not quite. \r\n\r\nYou see, while Kahoot has an API, their API is for **playing** Kahoots, not making them. And even if they DID have an API for my exact use case (they don't), their API is only for \"certain highest-tier [Kahoot] plans.\" and requires me to \"reach out to [my] customer success manager\" for access. I looked, and their highest plan is their Enterprise plan for a kajillion dollars. Probably should have figured when I found it under their enterprise support...\r\n\r\nBut I wasn't out of luck yet. While Kahoot doesn't have an API for making Kahoots, they do have manual ways for creating Kahoots. That means that I could make a web scraper to act like a human and \"manually\" create a Kahoot with some programmed instructions. Now armed with a plan of action, I threw together a program that used Selenium Base (a Python-based web scraper library) to generate a Kahoot based on information given to it in a dictionary. But after I made it, I realized that this might be a tool that people could find useful to use. And so, I decided to take the Kahoot bot I made and transform it into a library someone could pip install, do a bit of setup, and use on their own devices. \r\n\r\n\"But Jediweirdo,\" I hear you ask, \"aren't you basically done with this project?\" Hahahahahahahaha, no. While I started making this a library before joining this program, I'm nowhere near done. If I'm being kind, I'm like 20% or 30% through this process. I figured out how I want people to interact with the library and created the endpoints that users can use to access the library's internal code, but it flat out doesn't work due to problems I'm facing with idiot-proofing the soon-to-be-library. This includes stuff like making sure the title they passed isn't too long or making the any media they pass in is in a compatible format for Kahoot to use. After that's done, I still have to...\r\n- Fix the 1000000 bugs in the Kahoot generator program and create/handle failsafes in case something happens during Kahoot creation\r\n- Recreate Kahoot's Quiz file system to be interactable with Python\r\n- Recode the support for dictionary import support because it's buggy and sucks\r\n- Make it so you can change the settings of your kahoot via code \r\n- Redo my initialization code so that the Kahoot web scraper can use ANY credentials you pass into it to log you into your account (currently it's hardcoded to log in using the credentials to my Google account)\r\n- Figure out how to make documentation and other administrative tasks\r\n- Somehow beg PyPl to allow pip installs of my library (no clue how)\r\n- And many more that I probably missed...\r\nSo yeah, I still have my work cut out for me. Stay tuned for the future :)\r\n- Jediweirdo\r\n\r\nP.S: I made a GitHub you can track this with! However, I need to figure out how to delete sensitive data from the git history (I accidentally committed my friend's entire quotebook in past git commits, so I need to figure out how to get rid of it). After I do that, I'll update this project with the GitHub link :)\r\n\r\nP.P.S: If you want to see the Kahoot Generator in action, check out the attached video","id":201,"attachment":null,"project_id":402,"slack_id":"U091P7AH7V3","created_at":"2025-06-17T02:59:36.715Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T19:22:06.959Z"},{"text":"I started this project on Jun 7, 2025 because I wanted to learn a game engine.

Building on the original Timed Typer, this version brings notable improvements in usability, precision, and flexibility. It uses Python, Tkinter, PyAutoGUI, and optional dependencies like OpenCV, pystray, and pynput.  \r\nDevelopment Milestones  \r\nInitial Foundation (Original Timed Typer)  \r\n\r\nCore Functionality: I created a Tkinter-based GUI for typing text into any application at controlled speeds (30-2000 CPM), using PyAutoGUI for automation.  \r\nFeatures:  \r\n- Debug mode for console output.  \r\n- Target selection: current cursor, screen center, or click-based.  \r\n- Failsafe mechanism (move mouse to top-left corner to stop).  \r\n- Test mode to type \"Hello\" for verification.  \r\n- Customizable delay (0-60 seconds).  \r\n\r\nChallenges:  \r\n- Click detection was basic, requiring users to wait out the full timeout.  \r\n- Speed was defined in CPM, limiting flexibility for different use cases.  \r\n- No support for repeated typing or advanced targeting.  \r\n\r\nEnhancements in TypeRiser  \r\n\r\nNew Features:  \r\n- Time-Based Input: I replaced CPM with total time input (seconds, minutes, hours) for more intuitive control over typing duration.  \r\n- Repeat Functionality: I added repeat count (1-100) and pause between repeats (0-60 seconds) for automated, multi-pass typing.  \r\n- Text Import: I enabled importing text from .txt files to streamline input of large text blocks.  \r\n- Persistent Click Target: I implemented a saved click position that stays until reset, improving efficiency for repeated typing tasks at the same location.  \r\n- Image-Based Targeting: I integrated OpenCV (cv2) to locate targets through screenshot matching (confidence level 0.8), with a fallback if opencv-python is not available.  \r\n- System Tray Integration: I added an optional system tray icon using pystray and PIL for minimizing the app and quick access (show/hide, exit).  \r\n- Global Hotkey: I introduced a Ctrl+Shift+S hotkey using keyboard to stop typing instantly, working alongside the PyAutoGUI failsafe.  \r\n- Improved Click Detection: I replaced basic click detection with pynput.mouse for reliable, first-click capture within a 5-second window, ignoring subsequent clicks.  \r\n\r\nUI Improvements:  \r\n- Added a combobox for time unit selection (seconds, minutes, hours).  \r\n- Introduced a status label for the click target position, updating dynamically when set or reset.  \r\n- Enhanced instructions to include hotkey and persistent click target details.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Improvements:  \r\n- Improved error handling for file imports, input validation, and OpenCV operations.  \r\n- Ensured thread-safe operations for typing, click detection, and tray icon management.  \r\n- Added dynamic dependency checks for opencv-python, pystray, and PIL to provide graceful failure if unavailable.  \r\n- Optimized the typing process with pyautogui.moveTo before clicking for better accuracy.  \r\n\r\nChallenges Overcome  \r\n\r\nClick Detection: The original wait-for-click logic often missed clicks or required full timeout. Using pynput.mouse ensured reliable, single-click capture.  \r\nImage Targeting: Integrating OpenCV required addressing cases where the library or target image was unavailable, providing clear user feedback through status updates.  \r\nSystem Tray: I maintained functionality without dependencies by making pystray and PIL optional and adding fallback messages.  \r\nHotkey Management: Registering and removing the Ctrl+Shift+S hotkey cleanly on app exit was crucial to prevent resource leaks.  \r\nTime-Based Logic: Converting from CPM to total time meant recalculating typing intervals dynamically to ensure smooth pacing across different text lengths.  \r\n\r\nFuture Improvements  \r\n\r\n- Advanced Image Targeting: Support for multiple image targets or region-based matching for more complex automation tasks.  \r\n- Config Presets: Allow saving and loading configurations (text, time, target, etc.) for recurring tasks.  \r\n- Cross-Platform Testing: Validate compatibility on macOS and Linux, addressing any PyAutoGUI quirks.  \r\n- Accessibility Features: Add keyboard navigation and screen reader support for the Tkinter UI.  \r\n- Performance Optimization: Reduce CPU usage during long typing sessions with large repeat counts.  \r\n\r\nConclusion  \r\nTimed-Type marks a significant update of the original Timed Typer, providing better flexibility, precision, and ease of use. The addition of time-based control, persistent click targets, image-based targeting, system tray support, and global hotkeys makes it a powerful tool for those interested in automation, developers, and users focused on accessibility. The project continues to develop, with plans for more refinements and new features.  \r\nLast Updated: June 18, 2025","id":776,"attachment":null,"project_id":1207,"slack_id":"U092H53U8RW","created_at":"2025-06-18T02:52:00.341Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T19:22:43.854Z"},{"text":"WOW that was a long session.

It ensures that difficulty remains manageable and fun.\r\n\r\nInteractive Menu System\r\nA prominent main menu with choices such as \"START GAME,\" \"HOW TO PLAY,\" \"GAME DETAILS,\" and \"QUIT\"\r\n\r\nVisual Feedback: Buttons show highlight on hover and a brief flash on click.\r\n\r\nAudio Feedback: Clicking a button triggers distinct procedural tones.\r\n\r\nProcedural Music\r\nThere is a basic randomized melody in a chiptune style during gameplay, which cycles on each newly created world.\r\n\r\nIn-Game Art Customization\r\nBy pressing the C key, I can cycle through different preset color themes for the player, platforms, walls, and enemies.

Essentially, you can create templates for certain kinds of problems (ex: permutations, binary search, etc) using the command `cp-cli template --make name.ext --alias alias` the template subcommand has other arguments for useful things such as the `--make` command which allows you to make a template with the alias argument. So a binary search template command would look like:\r\n\r\n`cp-cli template --make binarySearch.cpp --alias binarySearch`\r\n\r\nand to use this template, simply use the command `cp-cli template --use alias --filename name.ext`.

Originally I didn't have an individual instance for each weapon, neither a class, but I realized that it would make adjusting the costs and damage wayyy easier. While coding the instance for each weapon, I remembered that I kept changing the costs and damage in my planning document, and also added weapons. So creating a weapon class would make adjusting the weapons way easier. \n\nI also edited the dialogue for when the player opens the shop. I especially reformatted the text and made each sentence have its own line instead having a paragraph in one print statement. This made reading the dialogue easier to read and prevented/fixed some of the issues I had when adjusting my code. \n\nI had to learn a bit about classes to create the weapon class. For the player class, I coded it more intuitively (class Player(): then just defining variables for the player, eg damage = 1). However, I learned that I would have to define parameters for the type of class the weapon class is. (initializing the class, self.damage, adding parameters, etc). Although I'm sort of experienced with coding, I had to learn about this a little more to make my code work. \n\nI feel pretty good about my project so far. My next tasks include designing the maze, extending the READ.me file a **LOT** more, and maybe implementing more features (maybe the player can choose their name and I can put their name into dialogue).","id":1657,"attachment":null,"project_id":1602,"slack_id":"U08UGTGS4HE","created_at":"2025-06-19T13:14:19.549Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T20:24:04.040Z"},{"text":"I have been working on this project for over an hour and a half but it the hackatime doesn't update it for some reason but here is an update!\r\nI have created the snake and its food but not any movements yet.

I finally got the transport logic working, vehicles now move smoothly from one station to the next using the wait times, just as planned. Toi make it smooth, I added a feature that allows the vehicle markers to accelerate and slow down depending oin how much time the next station is reporting. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nIf the upcoming station says \"3 minutes\" then the vehicle adjust its speed to get there in 3 minutes on the map too. If the station switches suddently from 3 to 1 minute, the vehicle speeds up smoothly and slows down smoothly as well to account for the delay.\r\n\r\nI actually went outside and tested the system for 2 hours straight myself, going on every form of public transport with my PC running the code to see if it was accurate. There are still some uncertaintes especially when ARRIVING at a station (the time says \"0 minutes\" so I have to figure out the speed for that) the rest is super accurate! Very proud.\r\n\r\nThe system tracks their movements accurately, updating everything in real-time. I also cleaned up the database structure, making it much more efficient and easier to scale later. It‚Äôs solid now.\r\n\r\nThe METRO (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5) is still giving me trouble, some bugs are holding it back, but I‚Äôm putting that aside for now.

Interpret 3D model\n2. Rasterize into triangles\n3. Print triangles onto pixel buffer\n4. Copy pixel buffer to display window\n\nStep 4 is easy, and this log is about step 3. The core of this is the simple `screenspace_draw_line()` function, which takes a pair of points and copies a line between them to the pixel buffer. \n\nThis function first determines the dy and dx of the line, then determines whether the slope is \u003c= 1 (dx \u003e= dy) or \u003e 1 (dy \u003e dx). If it's less than one, it iterates over every X-coordinate between the two points and determines the exact position of the line's Y-coordinate based on the slope and position of the first point. It then simply rounds the result to the nearest whole pixel. If the slope is greater than one, it does the same, iterating over the Y-coordinates and estimating X-coordinates instead.\n\nI had some issues along the way which aren't terribly interesting: lines had drastically wrong slopes because I completely didn't realize I was doing integer division (whoops...). I was also having an issue with high slope lines appearing extremely jagged and sparse, which was what prompted me to implement the Y-iteration method for lines with dx \u003e dy.\n\nNext up, RASTERIZATION!","id":407,"attachment":null,"project_id":537,"slack_id":"U0917AFR9DM","created_at":"2025-06-17T13:29:40.625Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T19:22:20.691Z"},{"text":"Today, I worked on improving the bike loading system in the CityBike project.

If there are too much pages, multiple PDFs are created and stored into a ZIP archive. This prevents crashes, but how much pages can be handled is different for each device and for each resolution, so it makes sense to keep this configurable. Optimally, in the future a PDF library would be used that can handle creating PDFs with arbitrary sizes well (because this should theoretically be possible) but I have not found one that is able to do that for Android yet.\r\nI also fixed another issue: If a scan job failed, some scanners were unavailable for some time after because they did not cancel the scanning job automatically when a new job was tried to be started.

Just kicking off the development of WattUp, my battery health app for Windows. The goal is to build something way better than the super basic Windows battery stats‚Äîwe‚Äôre talking actual insights, usage graphs, and health monitoring.\r\n‚úÖ What‚Äôs Done So Far:\r\n\r\nRight now, I‚Äôve set up the first piece of the puzzle: logging battery percentage over time.\r\n\r\nUsing Python and the psutil library, I‚Äôve written a simple script that pulls the current battery percentage and appends it to a CSV file at regular intervals. This CSV will be the base for plotting usage graphs later on.\r\n\r\nHere‚Äôs a quick peek at the flow:\r\n\r\n    Grab battery data using psutil.sensors_battery()\r\n\r\n    Log the timestamp and battery percentage\r\n\r\n    Append the data to battery_log.csv every few seconds/minutes\r\n\r\nIt's not fancy yet, but it‚Äôs solid and works reliably in the background.\r\nüîç Why Start With This?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how your battery drains (or charges) over time is the most useful thing Windows doesn‚Äôt show. This graph will eventually let users:\r\n\r\n    Visualize how fast their battery is draining\r\n\r\n    Spot apps or time periods with abnormal usage\r\n\r\n    Get better estimates on how long the battery will actually last\r\n\r\nüõ†Ô∏è Next Steps:\r\n\r\n    Build a lightweight tray app with a real-time graph (probably using matplotlib or plotly)\r\n\r\n    Add options for changing the logging interval\r\n\r\n    Start collecting other stats like charge rate, power plugged status, etc.\r\n\r\nEventually, I‚Äôll wrap it all in a proper UI with WinUI 3 or a nice front-end.\r\n","id":1454,"attachment":null,"project_id":1642,"slack_id":"U091SEHGETW","created_at":"2025-06-19T03:29:37.621Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T19:23:27.964Z"},{"text":"I believe I have fixed most of the interactivity issues!

Incredible! To do this, I implemented vertex culling, which checks for vertices outside of the bounds of the clip space cube. \r\n\r\nIf you saw my last devlog, you will know that clip space is an intermediate coordinate space in the graphics pipeline where the coordinates of all the vertices are represented with 3D coordinates that range between -1 and 1. Any vertices with coordinates outside of this range are outside of the camera's visual range. Pretty neat!\r\n\r\nDuring the culling step, the program iterates through all the triangles in the scene, looking for vertices that are outside of the visual range. \r\n\r\n1) If all three of a triangle's vertices are outside, it is simply discarded. \r\n\r\n2) If two of the vertices are out of range, the program determines where the triangle's sides intersect with the plane that represents the border of the clip space cube. Then, it replaces the original triangle with a new triangle with the one original vertex that's inside and the two points where the sides intersect the borders.\r\n\r\n3) Finally, if only one vertex is out of range, the program needs to create a trapezoid. That means two new triangles. It creates one triangle using the two points where the triangle's sides intersect the border and one of the original points that's in bounds, and a second triangle using the two points that are in bounds and one of the intersection points.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit hard to wrap your head around at first, but it's quite an elegant algorithm, I think. Next up, perhaps, I'll implement a way for the user to control the camera with the keyboard!","id":1795,"attachment":null,"project_id":537,"slack_id":"U0917AFR9DM","created_at":"2025-06-19T18:04:04.238Z","updated_at":"2025-06-20T01:26:56.882Z"},{"text":"\r\n\r\n-\u003e 3D WIREFRAMES! \u003c-\r\n\r\nFirst: my last post was super wrong about what the graphics pipeline is like. It's way more complicated than what I thought it was. The real pipeline looks a little something like this:\r\n\r\n1) Interpret 3D models into a local data structure for vertices and faces (which vertices connect to which others to make triangles)\r\n\r\n2) Transform the models into world space. This means adding a fourth coordinate (called the homogenous component and labeled w) on top of x, y, and z, and using matrix math to transform the vertices into absolute positions in the world.\r\n\r\n3) Transform the models into camera space. This changes each vertex's coordinates to be relative to the camera by multiplying the inverse of the matrix that describes the camera's position in the world. Basically, where is each vertex relative to the camera?\r\n\r\n4) Transform the models into clip space. This stage deals with perspective. Basically, this uses the camera's near and far viewing planes to create a frustum that describes what the camera can see, then normalizes it into a rectangular prism. In a frustum, the cross sections are larger the further you get from the camera. In clip space, we reshape the frustum so it becomes a rectangular prism, which draws points that are further from the camera closer into each other. That's the conceptual idea, anyway. This will significantly modify the homogeneous component (w) from earlier.\r\n\r\n5) Normalize into NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates). This simply divides each vertex's x, y, and z coordinates by w to put all the coordinates in a range between -1 and 1. Vertices not in this range should be removed, but mine just segfaults instead.\r\n\r\n6) Project to screen space coordinates. This extrapolates the x and y coordinates on the viewing screen for each vertex from the NDC space numbers using math that I don't entirely understand.\r\n\r\n7) Create triangles from the vertices and the list of face mappings.\r\n\r\n8) Draw the triangles to the screen using the system I devised earlier.\r\n\r\nwhew, that was a lot. My code has reached the point of doing all this stuff! Pretty neat right? I spent quite a lot of time researching this whole process. Most of the time, all of this processing happens inside the GPU, but this code implements the whole pipeline entirely with CPU. Next, I'll extend by culling out-of-frame vertices, filling in triangles, and adding support for color (maybe)!\r\n","id":1326,"attachment":null,"project_id":537,"slack_id":"U0917AFR9DM","created_at":"2025-06-18T22:06:44.384Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T19:23:20.224Z"},{"text":"Redesign \u0026 added icons for light mode","id":4742,"attachment":null,"project_id":1805,"slack_id":"U07FC7DP23U","created_at":"2025-06-23T08:11:56.090Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T23:14:55.675Z"},{"text":"stats page","id":3387,"attachment":null,"project_id":1201,"slack_id":"U092K8F2AAC","created_at":"2025-06-21T18:38:51.705Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T22:36:25.230Z"},{"text":"Basic editing has been implemented!!!\r\nthis might actually ship guys","id":2299,"attachment":null,"project_id":1995,"slack_id":"U09232V6XUH","created_at":"2025-06-20T14:19:14.980Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T03:44:07.093Z"},{"text":"Day 3:\r\nToday I added nothing on the frontend, but I have added features in the backend.

concept behind Anon Board, it was time to think about how it should look and feel.\r\nThis wasn‚Äôt just about visuals ‚Äî the entire user experience needed to match the emotional goal: calm, safe, anonymous expression.\r\n\r\nüéØ Design Goals\r\nI set a few principles to guide the UI:\r\n\r\nMinimal, dark UI ‚Äì emotions should stand out, not the interface\r\n\r\nColor as emotion ‚Äì color becomes the core language of the app\r\n\r\nNo distractions ‚Äì no usernames, no chat, no notifications\r\n\r\nMobile-first ‚Äì emotional reflection should feel natural on any device\r\n\r\nFeel like a space, not a feed ‚Äì the UI should feel ambient and open\r\n\r\nüé® Emotion-Driven Color Palette\r\nOne of the most important design decisions was to use colors to represent emotions instead of words or icons.\r\n\r\nHere's the initial color mapping I‚Äôm using:\r\n\r\nColor\tEmotion\r\nüîµ Blue\tSadness\r\nüî¥ Red\tAnger\r\nüü¢ Green\tHope\r\nüü° Yellow\tJoy\r\n‚ö™ White\tEmptiness\r\nüü£ Purple\tFear/Anxiety\r\n\r\nThese colors appear as floating dots on a dark canvas, giving the board a kind of emotional galaxy vibe.\r\n\r\nüß© Core UI Components\r\nFor now, I‚Äôm focusing on three main parts:\r\n\r\nThe Board View\r\n\r\nFullscreen canvas with randomly scattered colored dots\r\n\r\nEach dot = 1 anonymous message\r\n\r\nOn hover or tap: display the short emotional sentence\r\n\r\n\"Add Emotion\" Modal\r\n\r\nA floating button opens a minimal input modal\r\n\r\nText field + emotion color picker\r\n\r\nAfter submission, a new dot appears in real time\r\n\r\nColor Legend\r\n\r\nSubtle UI element showing what each color means\r\n\r\nLikely collapsible for mobile devices\r\n\r\nüì± Wireframes \u0026 UI Planning\r\nI sketched some basic wireframes using [Figma/pen and paper], keeping things simple:\r\n\r\nDark background\r\n\r\nDots have soft shadows and varying sizes\r\n\r\nModal opens with soft animation\r\n\r\nTypography is clean and subtle ‚Äî no branding, no noise\r\n\r\nYou can check out my moodboard and UI draft attached to this post!\r\n\r\nüí¨ What's Next\r\nIn Devlog #2, I‚Äôll start building the frontend using React + Tailwind CSS, and set up the basic board layout.\r\nI‚Äôll also explore how to store emotional entries (maybe Firebase or Supabase) and randomize the positions of the dots.\r\n\r\nüìé Attachment ideas for this devlog:\r\n‚úÖ Wireframes or Figma preview of the UI\r\n\r\n‚úÖ A screenshot of the emotion color palette\r\n\r\n‚úÖ GIF mockup or static preview of dot interaction\r\n\r\n‚úÖ The

I have been creating it for my own video game and decided to share with the world as well. The language is currently in closed beta but it will soon be in open beta hopefully. The syntax should be fairly easy to understand.\n\n\nHow it works is, Machine_6502 is a struct that holds the values of its registers as well as its own memory. You can use init to initialize it with default memory size (64 kb). It does not have an assembler for now, so you pass instructions as byte arrays. Each instruction has its own procedure and is called when the first byte of the instruction matches the procedure in INSTRUCTION_TABLE. The procedure receives a pointer to a Machine_6502, as well as the full instruction array and decides what to do with it. \n\n\nI have implemented some low hanging fruit right now and will continue to add more instructions. You can look at all the 6502 instructions from here: https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html\n\n\nHere is the github repo if anyone is interested: https://github.com/yasinkaraaslan/6502-jai\n\n\nI have also included an example of how it works as an image, as most people don't have access to the compiler and won't be able to test the emulator.","id":2689,"attachment":null,"project_id":174,"slack_id":"U092C66U9FS","created_at":"2025-06-20T23:45:44.194Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T13:09:42.800Z"},{"text":"implemented a really buggy review board for long sessions \r\nstill can't handle urls outside of nested ones for some reason and occasionaly glitches out for some reason and the buttons don't work but uh time to fix it","id":2260,"attachment":null,"project_id":1306,"slack_id":"U0817KE4AG2","created_at":"2025-06-20T13:12:42.525Z","updated_at":"2025-06-20T23:32:13.592Z"},{"text":"Implemented event logging and monitoring key changes that will later be used to render corresponding output.

I've introduced a Flask-based frontend, enabling users to upload videos directly through their browser and monitor the transcoding status in real-time.\r\n\r\nHere‚Äôs a breakdown of the key enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Flask Web Interface: I've integrated a Flask application directly into the Lambda function. This is served via API Gateway, allowing for a user-facing web UI. A new index.html template provides a clean, modern interface for video uploads.\r\n\r\n* Robust Multipart Uploads: To handle large video files efficiently, the frontend now uses a multipart upload strategy. It communicates with the backend to obtain pre-signed URLs, allowing the browser to upload files directly and securely to S3 in chunks. This makes the upload process more resilient and performant.\r\n\r\n* Real-time Status Page: Users can now track the progress of their video processing via a dedicated status page. This page provides real-time updates on the transcoding and transcription jobs, showing the current status and, upon completion, providing access to the processed files.\r\n\r\n* API Gateway Integration: The lambda_handler has been updated to intelligently route requests. It can now differentiate between S3 trigger events (for backend processing) and HTTP requests from API Gateway (for the frontend), using serverless-wsgi to serve the Flask application.\r\n\r\n* Dockerfile and Documentation: The Dockerfile has been updated to include the new dependencies (Flask, serverless-wsgi) and the web templates. The README.md has also been extensively updated to reflect these new features and provide clear instructions for deployment.","id":2855,"attachment":null,"project_id":531,"slack_id":"U091AJ8UHP1","created_at":"2025-06-21T05:24:10.146Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T22:24:47.351Z"},{"text":"Setup classes to handle gcode","id":4756,"attachment":null,"project_id":3097,"slack_id":"U091T6PP97F","created_at":"2025-06-23T08:47:30.986Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T23:16:01.150Z"},{"text":"I've revisited the project after a long time and decided on a layout inspired by someone else's personal page.

This will make it easier for anyone (including me) to get the system up and running quickly.\n\nAfter that, I'm finally diving into building the Django app to create a proper web interface for this system.

The hard part was going to be the rendering, though, especially keeping it performant. \r\n\r\nMy initial approach was to treat the heat as a sort of density and use the Marching Cubes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) algorithm, an algorithm that is able to turn a 3d grid of scalar density values into a triangle mesh. In this case, I was going to use it to turn heat into a triangle mesh, but the idea remains the same. However, while implementing Marching Cubes, I kept running into issues related to the generation and projection of triangles. Once I'd spent enough time staring at the code, I realized that trying to fix the code would be more trouble than it was worth. Then, while browsing through the Taichi documentation, I realized that Taichi provides its own voxel renderer, for use in a 100 line challenge. While I certainly wasn't going to be fitting any of my code in 100 lines, the renderer itself was still useful. After a lot of issues, I was finally able to get the fire rendering in 3d. However, there are still a lot more issues to tackle before the code is done. Firstly, that the fire is rendering upside-down. Next, it's not using the correct color. The empty pixels are still being rendered, instead of being discarded and transparent. The cube of fire is only being rendered on one side. \r\n\r\nAll of these issues mean that the 3d renderer is still not complete, though it is getting closer to it.","id":2422,"attachment":null,"project_id":1118,"slack_id":"U0923CX9XL1","created_at":"2025-06-20T18:52:10.402Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T09:31:02.109Z"},{"text":"Add game modes: default as training, waves and a 1 minute test, adjust for better scoring","id":2428,"attachment":null,"project_id":799,"slack_id":"U091L1X1XBM","created_at":"2025-06-20T18:56:04.826Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T09:31:28.025Z"},{"text":"Everything is printed out and assembled.

It's basically the same as the hallway chase so here's how the mirror works instead.\r\nFor planar reflections I added a camera that reflects the player camera's pose. The rendered image is mapped onto the reflector's surface using screenspace UVs.\r\nI'm using perspective projection instead of frustum projection, mainly because perspective has optimal pixel density (1:1 to the screen opposed to the inverse square law), and there's no issues with anti-aliasing.\r\n\r\nHowever perspective has one big issue which is near plane culling. If an object is behind the mirror in just the right way, it could obstruct the reflector camera. Since Godot doesn't support custom near plane matrix yet, I made a system where the reflector tries to find the optimal near plane based on its pose. \r\nThe system (dynamic near plane) tries to find the closest near plane to the reflection surface where none of the near plane exceeds the surface. However planes outside the reflector or camera frustum boundary is allowed to exceed the plane.\r\nConviniently, this also creates a quite optimal camera culling system for the reflectors, so it can be immediately paused when out of view. Unfortunately occlusion culling is nontrivial as that's done on the GPU, so I used manually placed activation areas to mimic occlusion culling for now.\r\n\r\nThe performance isn't perfect, and there's situations where it's impossible to get a perfect near plane, but combined with render layers it's okay for this project.","id":4611,"attachment":null,"project_id":2369,"slack_id":"U092EBP59B2","created_at":"2025-06-23T03:22:47.798Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T21:42:01.945Z"},{"text":"I added the belt tensioning and idler support to the X axis, I also rotated 180¬∫ the pulleys, as it wasn't necessary to have them so high","id":2995,"attachment":null,"project_id":907,"slack_id":"U078E6P6SAJ","created_at":"2025-06-21T10:10:58.736Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T10:18:25.320Z"},{"text":"Completed the README.md and FEATURES.md for NyxWrite.\r\nMarkdown part for NyxWrite done.\r\nNow coding it.","id":3004,"attachment":null,"project_id":2494,"slack_id":"U091ZHZT013","created_at":"2025-06-21T10:26:24.400Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T10:59:49.255Z"},{"text":"As a preliminary idea, I thought it would be really good to use the layout groups to create the neural network, but it's really shitty, to be honest.

I previously implemented camera controls including rotation, which worked using traditional matrix rotation manipulation. The problem with this is that, over hundreds of frames of manipulation, the camera matrix gets... corrupted, for lack of a better term. The rotation and scale numbers that take up the first 3x3 of the matrix become misaligned and it becomes impossible to properly reverse them in order to render the vertices.\r\n\r\nThe result of this is that, after rotating a bunch, the image gets really distorted and flattened in a weird way. Well, the solution to this is to encode rotation with quaternions, which aren't subject to any distortion. A quaternion is a 4D number represented as *a + bi + cj + dk* where a, b, c, and d are real numbers and i, j, and k are vectors. It's a bit wishy washy what all of that actually means, but the point is that we can use quaternions to encode rotation in 3D space.\r\n\r\nWell, I wrote a super simple quaternion library, and now store the position of the camera as a simple vector3, and the rotation as a quaternion. It all still ends up as transformation matrices in the end, but it's not prone to misalignment like this.

It's been very hard to debug as each time requires an entire qemu boot, and can only be debugged through serial output. You \"can\" use gdb, but theres essentially no way to use in within the efi application itself, it only functions on the kernel ELF which is after the bootloader.

Those are what I have been working on for the last few hours. Of course, none of them are perfect, rather far from it. However, their purpose never was to be perfect, but rather prove to myself this project is worth spending a lot of my time on in near future. And regarding this, I think I have succeeded. With my proof of concept working (flawed but working), I was able to see the potential of this project and brainstorm on new ideas, ranging from increased security to improved ease of use. These include, but are not limited to, a potential desing for a future user interface, a few ideas on a new algorithm and user secret schema, and a shift in my goals.\r\nUntil now, one of my main goals was to allow easy pen and paper calculation of passwords. But considering most password protected applications require the use of digital media anyways, I think I can now focus on increased security and pretty much ignore pen and paper calculation at all, as most users will have access to digital devices most of the time anyways.\r\nIn (near) future, I will try and implement a new and more secure algorithm for password generation, and increase the ease of use and installation to make this project more accessible to the broad population. My next milestone is a first (console based) prototype, which will then be further developed into a full-fledged both GUI and CLI based password manager with many different features to allow easy password calculation and insertion.\r\nFor now though, I will keep developing this project and enjoy the journey of the process, curious on what the outcome might be.","id":4221,"attachment":null,"project_id":1872,"slack_id":"U091MRX84AZ","created_at":"2025-06-22T17:49:21.152Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T19:37:50.091Z"},{"text":"I worked on debugging Bee's sprite movement so that you can also move diagonally and so that the animation moving up and down works.","id":6085,"attachment":null,"project_id":3516,"slack_id":"U08HLKGG56H","created_at":"2025-06-24T18:53:11.715Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T19:42:14.604Z"},{"text":"started website, designing and working on nav bar, etc.","id":5348,"attachment":null,"project_id":2322,"slack_id":"U07A5MMN4QN","created_at":"2025-06-23T21:54:00.815Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T06:45:05.217Z"},{"text":"Learned a bit of Unity today!

The original algorithm used a character-by-character comparison, which had a catastrophic flaw: after switching views or toggling the smooth cursor setting, typing anything would cause every subsequent character to be misaligned and counted as an error. This also caused the Net WPM to register as zero for the rest of the race. The bug was particularly problematic because it seemed like a UI issue when it was actually a fundamental calculation problem. I completely rewrote this using the Levenshtein distance algorithm, which properly calculates the edit distance and counts only actual mistakes rather than alignment issues. (The attached video demonstrates the first bug)\r\n\r\nI also solved a frustrating cursor line-wrapping bug where text would flicker and wrap erratically during typing. I implemented a new smooth cursor system, eliminating layout interference entirely. Both cursor modes now use stable positioning logic.\r\n\r\nFor the AI text generation, I enhanced the prompts to be more specific and to strip unwanted formatting like quotes and introductory phrases.

I have done this by simply adding one argument to the init call.\r\nI also added this to the sys prompt and tested it, and it actually works really great.\r\nThen I tried a few rounds, but the crewmates still won every game like huge gigachads, bullying every call from the Imposter.\r\nThey shot down every word from the imposter, even if it was a solid call. I asked myself why the heck this was happening, and then I realized it.\r\nI had called the 3 AI agents \"Crewmate1\", \"Crewmate2\", and \"Imposter1\". I did this for myself so I could see which of the players had which role.\r\nBut I didn't think about the fact that the LLMs would get a history which looks like this: \"Imposter1 said '...' with Response: ‚Ä¶\". You see the problem?\r\nThey always knew who the imposter was because the imposter didn't have a cool name; it was just called \"imposter,\" and that's why every round was pretty easy for the crewmates.\r\nI fixed this by just giving them names, and easy as that, I had my first round where they actually voted a crewmate out instead of the Imposter.\r\nYou can see this in the screenshot. Alex was the Imposter.\r\nThen, I also made it so the imposter won't comment on words because the sysprompt isn't good enough for this yet. Every time the imposter commented on something, it always revealed itself.\r\nBut those were all the changes I made today.\r\nAs always, you can see the GitHub commit here: https://github.com/blockplacer4/ImposterGameWithAI/commit/68f588b3f4aeaeec02c4ab1f5f0a5ec6630805e6","id":4429,"attachment":null,"project_id":1930,"slack_id":"U091Q6XL5R8","created_at":"2025-06-22T21:34:17.699Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T20:25:58.319Z"},{"text":"Worked on the dashboard of the app. I need to add more stats and graphs, etc.","id":5843,"attachment":null,"project_id":3446,"slack_id":"U092HJ71QM6","created_at":"2025-06-24T14:04:20.933Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T17:45:08.145Z"},{"text":"WONDERFUL WORK.

Alongside this, the post-race screen now clearly displays Net WPM and total errors, it gave it a complete overhaul. The old summary screen has been replaced with a much cleaner leaderboard that ranks players by performance. I also improved the personal performance chart. The hardest task I tackled was fixing a desynchronization bug that occurred when toggling the \"Scrolling View\" mid-race. My previous implementation would destroy and recreate the UI, causing the user's typed text to be lost visually and marking all subsequent characters as incorrect. To fix this, I refactored the logic to use a single, persistent text input that simply moves between two views. Now, instead of recreating everything, I just toggle the visibility of the views, which preserves the race state perfectly and makes the feature seamless and stable. Finally, I fixed a visual bug causing player cards to misalign. The issue stemmed from a conflict between grid styles in the static HTML and the dynamic JavaScript. I resolved it by removing the layout classes from the HTML, giving the JavaScript full control over the grid, which now aligns the cards correctly.\r\n\r\n","id":4547,"attachment":null,"project_id":1776,"slack_id":"U07G64ESXKR","created_at":"2025-06-23T00:57:03.764Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T21:18:36.424Z"},{"text":"I've added a button to the context menu to block the current webpage.","id":6371,"attachment":null,"project_id":1537,"slack_id":"U091QD4DGTD","created_at":"2025-06-25T01:17:57.066Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T01:17:57.824Z"},{"text":"Added skills.","id":6432,"attachment":null,"project_id":1805,"slack_id":"U07FC7DP23U","created_at":"2025-06-25T03:25:07.942Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T03:25:08.628Z"},{"text":"I added a GRUB-like bootloader to my webOS!","id":5996,"attachment":null,"project_id":3496,"slack_id":"U08MGN5EPHV","created_at":"2025-06-24T17:20:49.562Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T19:41:51.248Z"},{"text":"I spent 10 minutes defining the rest of the game essential functions","id":6643,"attachment":null,"project_id":3649,"slack_id":"U08PZB2S3BL","created_at":"2025-06-25T11:23:11.798Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T11:23:12.402Z"},{"text":"Today I created the model loading interface for the engine, with a model manager similar to the texture and shader managers.

Another change was making the equip weapon function output depend on the string value of the input instead of creating a function that could translate the string input to the instance of a weapon that could be equipped by the player. The main issue with this idea I had was that I didn't know how to do it, especially since I had searched up how to and didn't even know how to explain what I wanted to do. I found that it would be way easier for me to compare the value of `select` to the predetermined weapon instances/types, `stick`, `metal_sword`, `wooden_sword`, `bow`, and `dragonsblade` and make each individual `if` statement correspond to each weapon. \n\nSome other things I did included using the `lower()` function on certain parts of code to allow players to write their inputs a little faster. I realized that not everyone is well-versed in touch-typing (or some may not know that the code is case-sensitive), so I think doing this could help users at least a bit. Lastly, I fixed some bugs/things I forgot to code in the `purchasing()` function. I somehow forgot to continue the function or at least bring the user back to the `choose()` \"screen\", so I just added the `choose()` function as needed within both the `choose()` function and the `purchasing()` function (I love functions, if you can't tell). \n","id":3529,"attachment":null,"project_id":1602,"slack_id":"U08UGTGS4HE","created_at":"2025-06-21T21:53:44.336Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T00:11:12.724Z"},{"text":"Got it working so it shows OpenStreetMap when the app gets opened and zooms to country of the device","id":5725,"attachment":null,"project_id":3397,"slack_id":"U092NT94PL5","created_at":"2025-06-24T09:47:58.392Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T13:57:03.561Z"},{"text":"Developed and refined the navbar and adjusted the font. \r\nI might remove the navbar from the landing page but for now I will be keeping it.\r\nWill start my proper coding after my exam tomorrow.","id":5730,"attachment":null,"project_id":3156,"slack_id":"U092BF2BMM1","created_at":"2025-06-24T09:55:58.559Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T13:58:53.162Z"},{"text":"fixed matrix scanning,\r\nadded debugging modes,\r\nfixed some bugs.","id":5408,"attachment":null,"project_id":1937,"slack_id":"U07F798D3NF","created_at":"2025-06-23T23:12:37.346Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T07:40:25.218Z"},{"text":"Just starting out My Note taking app, specifically for coding and note taking. ü•≥","id":5415,"attachment":null,"project_id":3305,"slack_id":"U0921NG04MU","created_at":"2025-06-23T23:27:45.305Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T07:48:21.687Z"},{"text":"I just made it like About section but I'll edit it soon and make it look like category section not just About section cuz I don`t know what to write there, I made the images Draggable (with Framer-motion) but its will return to same position that was in it , and Its hard to make it Responsive So I just make it hidden in mobile View , u can drag it with your PC and Tablet  \u003c3 ","id":4519,"attachment":null,"project_id":2787,"slack_id":"U08BATE55GB","created_at":"2025-06-23T00:19:10.649Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T21:12:45.151Z"},{"text":"Checked the eBay API to attempt to connect it to my app. Needed to make an account, and it takes 1 business day to be accepted.","id":4521,"attachment":null,"project_id":1476,"slack_id":"U091FE5QJNT","created_at":"2025-06-23T00:23:35.816Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T21:12:48.795Z"},{"text":"I've fully switched to using program-counter for fetching and executing instructions.\n\nI've started implementing hardware part of the 6502 as well. I've created a pins struct that determines each pin's state (high or low). \n\nOne of the differences from the real chip is that we don't check for high -\u003e low, we keep the pin values as booleans (high as true, low as false) and just set handled pins to high. I am not sure if this is the best way to do it, it could get pretty complicated if you wanted to replicate the chip's behaviour while using this module.\n\nNow, for the pins to work, we need a notion of 'cycles' in our emulator. We have been just implementing and executing instructions directly, but in 6502 each instruction has a specified amount of cycles and clock pins signal a cycle. This is also needed for writing to/reading from address and data bus.\n\nSo how to do it then? There are a few ways but before that, I think it would be better if we switched to using x86 assembly instead of coding this by hand, which can get pretty complicated pretty quickly. This would also make our emulator a kind of 'JIT' compiler :) \n\nSo the next step would be starting on that, and it can make the code faster too I think.","id":4522,"attachment":null,"project_id":174,"slack_id":"U092C66U9FS","created_at":"2025-06-23T00:25:33.878Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T21:12:52.576Z"},{"text":"Very simple UI creation!","id":4526,"attachment":null,"project_id":3019,"slack_id":"U092GDUNH0C","created_at":"2025-06-23T00:28:06.701Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T21:12:56.686Z"},{"text":"I fixed some issues with the habit creation and I completly redesigned the whole time limit selector so it is more user frenly and not so overwhelming and some more fixes and refactors","id":6118,"attachment":null,"project_id":163,"slack_id":"U090H43TYTU","created_at":"2025-06-24T19:32:41.410Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T19:42:31.717Z"},{"text":"I started with the database integration into the app, but it didnt work as expected, i took way too much time trying to fix bugs, so im gonna focus on organizing my ideas with diagrams and project management tools to have less problems when trying to code everything, specially since theres a bunch of data, tables and relations that i cant keep track of","id":5576,"attachment":null,"project_id":2325,"slack_id":"U09229UEV2P","created_at":"2025-06-24T04:24:34.197Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T09:52:44.255Z"},{"text":"continued to work on security impementation and modulizing the drawing pad for ease of use also worked on logos","id":5863,"attachment":null,"project_id":365,"slack_id":"U08CRHSQYTX","created_at":"2025-06-24T14:36:16.911Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T18:07:32.964Z"},{"text":"üõ†Ô∏è Client of Making (Alpha 2p6.0) üõ†Ô∏è\r\nThis is a preview update and is NOT finished ‚Äî the update's close to finishing!\r\n\r\n    ü©ª Skeleton Loading Animation!\r\n    üóíÔ∏è README.md and CHANGELOG.md Files!\r\n    üõíüí® Sidebar Animation for Shop Icon!\r\n    ‚ú® Multi-selection for Shop Item Categories!\r\n    üí´ Many QoL-related updates for the Shop!\r\n    üì± Partial Mobile Support!","id":6291,"attachment":null,"project_id":2054,"slack_id":"U088Z65TDRN","created_at":"2025-06-24T22:26:16.809Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T22:26:21.012Z"},{"text":"Currently suffering on 88x31 : i've deleted a v for the 23rd time now : i've spent 1h trying to make a text and i cant do it :heavysob:","id":6214,"attachment":null,"project_id":225,"slack_id":"U08L7671TDG","created_at":"2025-06-24T20:54:51.041Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T20:54:51.668Z"},{"text":"worked on adding the new camera system, had to remove old mesh optimisation, ill work on the core functions like adding and changing voxels before adding optimisations","id":6000,"attachment":null,"project_id":2208,"slack_id":"U091Q590LUU","created_at":"2025-06-24T17:24:47.462Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T19:41:52.792Z"},{"text":"I added clap and color_eyre for the command line and error handing, i made it so if you run the exe with a command after it, it runs the command when you win.\r\n\r\nNext Steps.\r\n- Add ratattui or something like it so there is graphics when playing\r\n- There is a punishment if you fail the paper scissors rock.\r\n- Different themes, e.g gun, nuke, creeper.\r\n- Setup github and allow people to use","id":6376,"attachment":null,"project_id":3579,"slack_id":"U082RHUC2TF","created_at":"2025-06-25T01:25:42.377Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T01:25:43.081Z"},{"text":"Wow, we're getting places!

I've refactored key parts of the application to improve performance and maintainability, and I've added several new API endpoints to enhance its capabilities.\n\n**Here‚Äôs a summary of the key changes:**\n\n* **Configuration via Environment Variables:**\n  I've externalized several settings into environment variables (`GENERATE_DASH`, `GENERATE_SUBTITLES`, `THUMBNAIL_WIDTH`, `LAMBDA_FUNCTION_URL`). This allows for greater flexibility in deploying and managing the application without requiring code changes.\n\n* **Efficient Streaming with S3 Pre-signed URLs:**\n  The `/stream/` endpoint has been completely overhauled. Instead of proxying video data through the Lambda function, it now generates and redirects to a secure, time-limited S3 pre-signed URL. This offloads the bandwidth-intensive work to S3, resulting in a significant performance boost and cost savings.\n\n* **Enhanced API and Asset Management:**\n\n  * **Decoupled IDs:** The application now uses a redirect system to map the original video filename to a unique, content-based processing ID (its MD5 hash). This makes the API more stable and decouples it from the original filename.\n  * **DELETE Endpoint:** A new `DELETE /api/video/\u003cvideo_id\u003e` endpoint has been added, allowing for the complete removal of a video and all its associated processed files.\n  * **In-Progress Status:** A new `/api/transcoding_status` endpoint provides a way to monitor jobs that are currently being processed.\n  * **Automated Cleanup:** The application now automatically deletes temporary audio files from S3 after transcription is complete, helping to keep storage costs down.\n\n* **Improved Thumbnails:**\n  In addition to the VTT sprites for timeline previews, the application now generates a high-quality primary thumbnail from the middle of the video, providing a better visual representation in the video gallery.","id":4751,"attachment":null,"project_id":531,"slack_id":"U091AJ8UHP1","created_at":"2025-06-23T08:29:59.727Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T23:15:30.550Z"},{"text":"I've started laying out the board.

Modify the backend so it doesn't use hardcoded variables and get the values from a `.env` file or a `settings.ini` file.\r\n2. Make the dashboard load from the backend without needing to be a file written inside the folder and depending on what permissions the user has to run. Example: if I do not have a token / cookie that allows me to enter, right now what happens is that it loads for half a second the page and then redirects me to the login, I want it not to load the page but to load the login and if it could not enter a warning about why it could not enter and try again.\r\n3. To make a database of users that can enter to a machine and that each one has its own permissions. that in a C++ structure would look like this:\r\n```cpp\r\ntypedef bool Permissions[7];\r\n\r\nstruct User\r\n{\r\n\tstring name;\r\n\tstring password_hash;\r\n\tPermissions permissions;\r\n}\r\n````\r\n### Permissions thought:\r\n\r\n- Shutdown\r\n- Restart\r\n- Lock\r\n- Play/Pause\r\n- Volume\r\n- System Metrics\r\n- Modify commands (Linux only)\r\n\r\n3.

As the project description says, I'm creating a Minecraft mod that allows you to broadcast your singleplayer/multiplayer gameplay as a fake Minecraft server that allows people to join and spectate you as if they were watching a ReplayMod replay (they can't actually interact with anything). To do this, I'm capturing all the packets the host client receives from the server they're on (I'm starting with multiplayer first, singleplayer might be a bit different) and then storing and sending them to the spectator clients through a barebones Netty server.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I spent a lot of time today rewriting Minecraft's networking code to work without a MinecraftServer object so that I can use it in my own Netty server. I think I'm basically done, but I've hit a roadblock with an EncoderException and NullPointerException that appears whenever I send a packet to the client. From looking at the logs, I suspect that the error comes from a problem with the Packet registry. I'm guessing the MinecraftServer class has a filled registry that I'm missing, but there's a lot of code to read over and some of it is a bit beyond me (I haven't used Java in quite a while).

I'm sure something will come up later, but it's working well enough now for me to continue.\r\nNext, logarithms. I spent a little while learning about how they actually work; much less superficially than I thought I knew them before. My implementation uses a series to calculate natural logarithms. I then use this to calculate log base 2, which takes advantage of the fact that IEEE-754 floating point is basically just scientific notation to make it ridiculously fast.

The build process is now in package.json(I had to change package.json SO MANY TIMES because builds were failing and all that) Not to mention sometimes the whole Vercel page just said 404, and that was even worse, because every time something went well 15 more errors just popped up in front of me!(Well probably not cause IT WAS SO HARD TO DEBUG) but it's finally pretty stable, of course there are a lot of missing features but the widgets should be working adn you can access it at https://aetheris-sigma.vercel.app/ . It says here I spent 1 hour and 1 min and 55 seconds, but I actually spent 1 hour and 40 minutes, it shows that in my coding project, I don't know why it is showing less time here. Not to mention when the OpenAI key did start working I had to spend another few minutes fixing the fact that the response was not showing although the logs were showing code 200 and the response was being processed.\r\n\r\n(I also used my previous project folders to help me find out the cause of all the errors happening with Vercel and the 404 errors, I just made the project structure of this project work the same as my other Vercel projects)\r\nWhat did I use AI for?

This is a really smooth stack to work with, it makes it easy for me to handle authentication and database queries through server functions. When I push any changes, Vercel just builds and ships it! I've managed to create and run the whole project for free, but it may not stay that way in the future depending on how many users I get. \r\nThat being said, if you want to see this project grow further in the future, please feel free to give me some support! Go to https://mrdiamond.is-a.dev/support if you would like to give me a hand.\r\n\r\nAuthentication\r\nI use AuthJS, which makes it super easy to set up any authentication. There are probably less than 100 lines of code currently handling authentication. It's a really nice framework!\r\n\r\nDatabase\r\nAt first, I was using Prisma ORM, but as it turns out, it doesn't run very well when it comes to serverless in my experience. I wanted to try something new anyway, so I switched to Drizzle ORM. It's much smoother and more tightly integrated to my workflow!\r\nSupabase is also a very good db provider, it just works and it's free.\r\n\r\nStruggles\r\nAt first, I was also trying to deploy to Cloudflare Workers. After \"wrangler\"ing with it for hours, I gave up. Workers is extremely hard to deploy NextJS on. Every error I got didn't seem to match anyone else's errors, and I couldn't solve any problem that arose. I switched to Vercel and on the second build, everything was up and working. I am really disappointed with Cloudflare Workers and Wrangler, they don't have very good documentation and it is extremely hard to configure an existing project to use Wrangler. There are much better options, and even some with better free tiers. I also tried CF pages, but that also just didn't work.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, the app is fully functional!

I began by setting up the bare bones of the application, authorization, and fetching the data from Last.FM's API\r\n\r\nMy first real task was tackling a security issue. I needed to connect to the Last.fm API to get user data, but I had to make sure my API key was kept secret and not exposed in the browser for anyone to see. I quickly reworked how the app gets its data, creating a secure, server-side channel that protected my key while still fetching all the music information I needed.\r\n\r\nOnce the connection was secure, I turned my attention to the data itself. The Last.fm API sends a lot of information, much of which I didn't need, like image links, tags and lists of similar artists. To keep things fast and focused, I started trimming this down, stripping out the unnecessary fields. I then cleaned up the artist bios, which were often messy, to make sure the data the data for AI was neat and consistent.\r\n\r\nThen came the most challenging and exciting part: bringing the AI to life. My vision was for an interactive experience where the AI wouldn't just spit out a generic roast but would actually engage with the user without having a large database of prepared roasts and jokes, like the judge-my-music on pudding.cool does. Getting the AI to properly ask all the different types of questions was tricky.

The concept was clear: a card-flipping game where players match math expressions with their correct results ‚Äî combining education with fast-paced fun.\r\n\r\nGame Logic \u0026 Design\r\nI started by designing a dynamic card generator that shuffles pairs of expressions and answers. Each card holds either an equation (like 5 + 3) or its solution (8). I implemented a match-checking algorithm that compares flipped cards using a match reference, ensuring only correct pairs are counted.\r\n\r\nLevel System\r\nTo make the game progressively harder, I introduced a 5-level structure. With each level:\r\n\r\nThe number of cards increases.\r\n\r\nThe available time decreases.\r\n\r\nThe challenge becomes sharper.\r\n\r\nScore \u0026 High Score\r\nI added a live score tracker and used localStorage to store the high score across sessions. This gave the game a sense of persistence and replayability.\r\n\r\nWin/Lose Flow\r\nA clean win screen shows the final score and high score after completing all 5 levels.
