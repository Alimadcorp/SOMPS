To fix it, I built TechnikTeam, a custom web platform that acts as the single source of truth for all our operations. It's a full-stack Java application designed to bring order and professionalism to our student-run events.\n\n🚀 Core Features:\n\nEvent Scheduling & Crewing: Plan events, define roles (like \"sound tech\"), and assign crew members based on their skills.\nLive Event Dashboard: During a show, assigned members get a real-time dashboard with a group chat and a shared task list to stay in sync.\nQR-Powered Inventory: Catalog all our gear. Anyone can scan a QR code on a piece of equipment to see what it is and where it belongs, and crew members can check items in or out.\nInteractive Skills Matrix: A huge grid that visually tracks which crew members are trained on which equipment, making it easy to find the right person for the job.\nRole-Based Access: A full admin panel for leaders and a streamlined view for student crew members.\nTech Stack\nJava (Servlets/JSP), MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Apache Tomcat.\n\nWhat I Learned\nFull-Stack Development: I built the entire system myself, from designing the relational database schema in MySQL to coding the backend logic in Java and building the dynamic frontend with JSP and JavaScript.\nSolving a Real Problem: This wasn't a tutorial. I had to talk to my crew, understand their pain points, and design features that actually made their lives easier.\nComplex Systems Design: I learned how to architect interconnected features, like making the inventory reservations appear on the event pages and building the complex data queries needed for the interactive skills matrix.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Imjack1-cyber/TechnikTeam","slack_id":"U091MUWD64V","created_at":"2025-06-16T20:22:16.243Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T06:34:32.934Z","author_name":"jacques.s","author_real_name":"Imjack1","author_timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","timezone_offset":7200,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07cf8fb476d4d78f1c2bc831ba8efcb1.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0019-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM2NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ebd261503992c6852df8401315105ef301700c6d/Screenshot%202025-06-20%20at%2018-19-50%20Home%20-%20Technik%20Team.png","author":"Imjack1","devlogs":"8","time":"22h 23m"},"256":{"id":256,"title":"BARCS Vaccination Clinic","description":"BARCS needs help automating the process of their vaccination clinics","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peppermint-juli/BARCS-Vaccination-Clinic/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/peppermint-juli/BARCS-Vaccination-Clinic","slack_id":"U0922TFUK09","created_at":"2025-06-16T20:23:12.654Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T20:25:31.592Z","author_name":"mj.jaime10","author_real_name":"Juliana Jaime","author_timezone":"America/New_York","timezone_offset":-14400,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0e246fd32a277ab2aff0e50ad139a3a.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0008-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png","author":"Juliana Jaime","devlogs":"0","time":"0h 0m"},"257":{"id":257,"title":"Blueprint Framework","description":"The industry-leading modding platform for the Pterodactyl® panel.

At its core is the Achernar Daemon, a headless service written in Rust and C++ that runs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson, or field laptops. This daemon handles camera interfacing (via V4L2 or ASI SDK), real-time frame capture, debayering, and hardware encoding, with integrated ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for on-device inference. It runs a local REST API (via actix-web or warp) to expose control interfaces.\n\nThe AI layer performs offline inference to suggest focus, exposure, and filter settings based on local environmental conditions, using quantized ONNX models that are confidence-based and never enforced. Imaging sessions are organized in a local-first folder structure, saving FITS files, logs, and preview videos, with append-only JSON logs and optional SQLite used for dashboard caching. When internet becomes available, sessions can be automatically synced to S3, Google Drive, or Dropbox via rclone or custom Rust logic.\n\nUsers interact through either a WebApp PWA, designed with React or SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS, or a Desktop App for advanced control. The WebApp is served from the edge device over a local Wi-Fi hotspot, enabling users to preview live streams (MJPEG or WebRTC), pick targets, and start imaging directly from their phone or tablet. The Desktop App—built using Qt or Tauri—caters to professionals with tools for FITS inspection, focus metric plotting, and full mount control (via INDI or ASCOM). All user sessions are secure, crash-safe, and never rely on cloud services for imaging, making Achernar robust for remote or off-grid astronomy. Cloud sync and remote dashboards activate only post-session, ensuring reliability with WebSockets for control and WebRTC tunnels for live previews, hosted optionally via Next.js or SvelteKit on platforms like Vercel.\n\nAlso, beacause im like activley working on this, i only have the github, im working on the readme and the demo link tho, i want to get an mvp done by like julys end","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/ibrahimshahid1/Achernar.tech","slack_id":"U07A1PR6XBP","created_at":"2025-06-16T23:38:54.158Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T23:38:54.158Z","author_name":"ibrahimthetechguy","author_real_name":"Ibrahim Shahid","author_timezone":"America/New_York","timezone_offset":-14400,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2024-06-27/7344729980242_c99d14818cd6481de9b6_192.jpg","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTI3MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1408b81c730e921a8a7fa8a68f5967f523e76d4e/Screenshot%202025-06-22%20073416.png","author":"Ibrahim Shahid","devlogs":"1","time":"0h 21m"},"378":{"id":378,"title":"Lightning","description":"Lightning is a lightweight and fast app launcher for MacOS created using Rust and AppKit.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U0919GUQ4K1","created_at":"2025-06-16T23:41:17.118Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T23:41:17.118Z","author_name":"johannovak7","author_real_name":"Johan N","author_timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","timezone_offset":-25200,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a97954fa83fd3714100c3fddf120a54.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0009-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png","author":"Johan N","devlogs":"0","time":"2h 43m"},"379":{"id":379,"title":"SaifURLs","description":"This is a short URL service that I have built using ReactJS and React Router for the frontend and ExpressJS for the backend.

My project features a bot for Discord communities to create detailed timers, alarms, and reminders in their Discord server. This project is very special to me because it was actually my very first coding project back in 2020! A project so small also happened to be the project that helped me discover my true passion for coding, and helped me start my journey with Node.js development. For years now, Discord has lacked a native way to create timers, alarms, and reminders in Discord servers (a rather simple feature that many large communities have asked for). This bot is my attempt to finally solve that problem once and for all!\n<br>\nI started developing this bot back in middle school, but over time, it became too overwhelming with the constant changes to Discord's API. With factors outside of my reach like rising server costs and busy study nights throughout the week, I eventually decided to shut down the project. Well, my goal this week is to try and bring it back to life, and rebuild the entire thing from the ground up!\n<br>\nI'll be honest, being my first ever coding project, Timer Bot was definitely the sloppiest code I've ever written (nowhere near being production-ready). So I figured why not spend this Summer rewriting the entire thing from scratch. I recently picked up some new equipment to help keep my personal projects running (like websites and Immich servers), so this is my attempt of reviving it and giving it another life :)\n<br>\nFeatures:\n- (⏱️) Create precise timer countdowns with hours, minutes, and seconds.\n- (⏰) Schedule alerts for specific dates and times in your local time zone.\n- (📝) Add titles and descriptions to your alarms to be notified of your upcoming events, goals, and more!\n- (💾) Save timer configurations with custom names for quick access anytime.\n- (📋) Manage all your running timers, alarms, and reminders in one place.\n- (🌐) Set your local time zone for accurate alarm scheduling.\n- (🔔) Choose users or roles to notify when an event ends.","category":"Something

This deeply inspired me to create a solution that could empower them with the right information at the right time. I’ve always been passionate about technology and artificial intelligence, and I wanted to apply these tools to solve real-world problems.\n\nThe idea of combining AI with agriculture came from observing how data-driven systems are transforming industries, while agriculture still faces huge gaps in access to information. I realized that even small changes—like recommending the right crop or identifying pests early—could have a big impact on a farmer’s income and food security. That’s what motivated me to build this AI-based platform: to support farmers, reduce resource waste, and make agriculture smarter and more sustainable.\n\nWhat it does\nThis project is an AI-powered farming assistant that helps farmers make smart, data-driven decisions to increase productivity and reduce waste. Based on inputs like weather, soil type, pH, NPKC levels, and farm size, it performs the following key functions:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crop using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), based on soil and environmental conditions.\n\nIrrigation & Water Prediction: Uses ANN to recommend the best irrigation method and estimate the right amount of water needed.\n\nYield Prediction: Predicts potential crop yield using ANN, helping farmers plan better.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: Uses a Random Forest model to recommend the correct type of fertilizer based on nutrient levels and crop type.\n\nFertilizer & Pesticide Quantity Estimation: An ANN model calculates the exact amount of fertilizer and pesticide needed, avoiding overuse and reducing costs.\n\nThe platform uses a Next.js frontend for user interaction and a FastAPI backend to process the inputs and return AI-generated recommendations. It aims to make farming more precise, efficient, and accessible for all.\n\nHow we built it\nWe built this project using a modern and scalable tech stack, combining machine learning models with a full-stack web application.\n\nFrontend: We used Next.js to build a responsive and interactive frontend that allows farmers to input data such as soil type, pH, NPKC levels, weather details, and farm size. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and mobile-compatible for easy access.\n\nBackend: The backend is powered by FastAPI, a fast and efficient Python web framework. It handles incoming requests, processes data, communicates with the machine learning models, and returns predictions to the frontend.\n\nMachine Learning Models:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze environmental and soil parameters.\n\nIrrigation and Water Requirement: An ANN predicts the most suitable irrigation method and how much water the crop will need.\n\nYield Prediction: Another ANN model estimates the potential yield based on input factors.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: A Random Forest classifier determines the best fertilizer based on soil nutrients and crop type.\n\nFertilizer & Pesticide Quantity: An ANN model calculates precise quantities required to avoid overuse.\n\nTraining & Data: We trained our models using agricultural datasets containing soil, weather, and crop data. Each model was evaluated and fine-tuned to improve accuracy and generalization.\n\nAll components are integrated seamlessly, ensuring that users get real-time, reliable insights through a web-based interface.\n\nChallenges we ran into\nBuilding this AI-powered farming assistant as a solo developer was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I encountered several obstacles throughout the development process:\n\nData Collection & Cleaning: Finding accurate, real-world agricultural datasets was difficult. I had to combine multiple sources and spend time cleaning, organizing, and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for model training.\n\nChoosing the Right Models: Selecting the best algorithms for different tasks required experimentation. I tried various models before finalizing ANN for crop prediction, water estimation, and yield prediction, and Random Forest for fertilizer recommendations. Fine-tuning them to get good accuracy without overfitting took time.\n\nFeature Selection: Understanding which input features (like pH, NPKC, farm size, etc.) were most relevant for each prediction task was a major challenge. I had to study agricultural practices and test combinations to get meaningful outputs.\n\nFrontend-Backend Integration: Connecting the Next.js frontend with the FastAPI backend was tricky. I ran into CORS issues and had to carefully manage API routing and request handling to make the data flow smooth and responsive.\n\nBalancing Accuracy & Simplicity: While aiming for high model accuracy, I also had to ensure the system remained simple enough for farmers to use. It was tough to design a system that’s both powerful and practical.\n\nDesigning a User-Friendly Interface: I had to make the UI intuitive, clean, and usable even on mobile devices, keeping in mind that many users may not be tech-savvy. Creating a smooth user experience took multiple design iterations.\n\nWorking alone pushed me to learn, adapt, and solve problems independently, and this experience helped me grow both technically and personally.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nBuilt a Complete AI Solution from Scratch: I successfully designed and developed an end-to-end AI system that predicts crops, irrigation needs, fertilizer types, and yield using real agricultural data.\n\nIntegrated Full Stack Technologies: I built a fully functional frontend using Next.js and connected it seamlessly to a FastAPI backend, managing both UI design and backend logic on my own.\n\nTrained Multiple ML Models: I implemented and trained multiple machine learning models (ANN and Random Forest) tailored for specific agricultural predictions, achieving good accuracy and real-world usability.\n\nDesigned a Clean, Usable Interface: I created a user-friendly web interface that’s responsive and accessible, ensuring ease of use even for farmers with limited technical knowledge.\n\nLearned & Applied Real-World Problem Solving: I tackled real-world issues like data inconsistency, model selection, and feature engineering, and found effective solutions through research and persistence.\n\nStayed Consistent & Self-Motivated: As a solo developer, I’m proud that I stayed committed, organized, and motivated through each phase—from planning and coding to testing and deployment.\n\nWhat we learned\nThroughout this project, I gained valuable experience and technical skills across multiple areas:\n\nApplied Machine Learning in Agriculture: I learned how to train and evaluate ML models like ANN and Random Forest for real-world agricultural use cases, including crop prediction, yield estimation, and fertilizer recommendations.\n\nFull-Stack Development: I improved my skills in both frontend and backend development using Next.js and FastAPI, learning how to integrate APIs, manage state, and build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.\n\nData Handling & Preprocessing: I learned the importance of clean, relevant data. I developed skills in data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare datasets for model training.\n\nModel Optimization & Evaluation: I gained hands-on experience in tuning hyperparameters, avoiding overfitting, and improving model accuracy and generalization.\n\nProblem-Solving & Debugging: I faced many technical challenges, especially in backend integration and model deployment, which taught me to troubleshoot issues methodically and stay persistent.\n\nUser-Centric Thinking: Designing an interface with farmers in mind taught me the value of simplicity and accessibility in tech solutions.\n\nThis project gave me the confidence to build practical AI tools and showed me how technology can make a real difference in critical fields like agriculture.\n\nWhat's next for FarmAI\nFarmAI is already live and deployed at farmai-nine.vercel.app(since its backend is hosted on Render's free tier its backend works slow sometimes), providing farmers with AI-powered recommendations. But this is just the beginning. Here's what's next for FarmAI:\n\nFrontend Enhancements & New Features: Continue improving the user interface for a better user experience, adding new functionalities, and optimizing the app for faster loading times.\n\nMultilingual Support: Add support for regional languages to make the platform more accessible to farmers from different areas, especially those in rural regions.\n\nIntegration with Real-Time APIs: Incorporate real-time weather and soil data APIs to provide more accurate predictions based on live environmental conditions.\n\nDatabase Expansion: Add more crop varieties, soil types, and fertilizer profiles to ensure the system caters to a broader set of geographical areas and farming needs.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"https://youtu.be/GV4v6cYUlmA?si=HHQWzP0Hty7TgCok","repo_link":"https://github.com/sidjain1239/farmai-frontend","slack_id":"U091RQ4BPEH","created_at":"2025-06-17T10:42:42.005Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T10:50:25.607Z","author_name":"sjain280310","author_real_name":"Siddharth Jain","author_timezone":"Asia/Kolkata","timezone_offset":19800,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0343ca8f203eeba189f283913e03b555.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0026-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png","author":"Siddharth Jain","devlogs":"0","time":"0h 8m"},"733":{"id":733,"title":"YT-Downloader","description":"Download Videos in the highest quality avaiable","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luckmuc/Youtube-Downloader/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/Luckmuc/Youtube-Downloader/blob/main/README.md","repo_link":"https://github.com/Luckmuc/Youtube-Downloader","slack_id":"U091H6KD6TG","created_at":"2025-06-17T10:44:22.664Z","updated_at":"2025-06-26T20:11:39.765Z","author_name":"valentin","author_real_name":"Valentin Dombret","author_timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","timezone_offset":7200,"author_pronouns":"he/his","author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-18/9072065116068_8531df507fe0be9ce006_192.jpg","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjYyLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--d2a5d56ae223eacbac426a82663de6cfec81d18a/Bild_2025-06-17_124520322.png","author":"Valentin","devlogs":"4","time":"1h 50m"},"734":{"id":734,"title":"Video streaming to unity","description":"Stream video from web to unity vr ","category":"Mobile App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U091TJSHYSW","created_at":"2025-06-17T10:47:36.944Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T10:47:36.944Z","author_name":"16pm2002","author_real_name":"Pratik","author_timezone":"Europe/London","timezone_offset":3600,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/636bffa76131315cdd4d6e3ea0d4e254.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0012-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njc0LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--fd339861b0f3e462f819d47e5fa19f6b8ee04ca6/Screenshot%202025-06-17%20114810.png","author":"Pratik","devlogs":"1","time":"0h 31m"},"735":{"id":735,"title":"StoryChain","description":"A collaborative storytelling mobile application - I have seen communities where people contribute to make a story.

(Don't replace your commas with slashes because someone said so!!)\n\nAdditionally Oscilloscope Online also handles null values better to ensure the plotting never stops!!\nThe graph isn't just a picture either!

recharge my cellular and home Wi-Fi at the same time,\nso I can instead use this project.\n\nIts key innovations include:\n• Autonomous mesh network formation with multi-client VPN server supporting 10 device connections\n• Good for battery-optimised performance\n• Management dashboard made with Flutter and React for web and smartphone support\n• It eliminates the traditional limitation of ESP32 VPN implementation by combining WireGuard and ESP32 mesh protocol — hence we can achieve a 15+ Mbps internet connection throughput using it, while having low power consumption\n\nApplications:\n• Personal internet sharing\n• Enterprise remote access\n• Emergency communication\n• IoT fleet management","category":"Something

It allows for loading customer and bike information from files, simulating reservations for electric and mechanical bikes, and calculating the costs associated with each customer. Customers can make reservations for mechanical bikes, which have no cost, or electric bikes, which have a base cost with discounts depending on their type (YOUNG or SENIOR). The system simulates 100 reservations for each day in June 2025, randomly assigning bikes to customers. At the end, the system calculates the total cost of each customer's reservations and determines who has the highest accumulated cost.\n\nThe code is structured into several classes, such as CityBike, Cliente, Bicicleta, Estacion, and Reserva, with key methods that allow loading data from binary and CSV files, simulating reservations, and calculating the associated costs. The system also handles possible errors in input data and ensures that bikes and stations are managed correctly. Information about customers, reservations, and costs is presented clearly and concisely, and the customer with the highest cost is easily identified, providing a clear view of the system's usage and costs.\n\nI programmed this in Spanish because it is my native language and the one I feel most comfortable with.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://github.com/alainGit-stack/cityBike/commits?author=alainGit-stack","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/alainGit-stack","slack_id":"U092D0ZPA8Y","created_at":"2025-06-17T18:07:04.210Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:18:39.928Z","author_name":"comba.alain","author_real_name":"comba","author_timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","timezone_offset":7200,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0028c594803cfeb3110a287e096de4c.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0016-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTkzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--420df1952a48feeb711e3e718a2d5d5f3307a10b/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202025-06-17%20201207.png","author":"comba","devlogs":"1","time":"2h 16m"},"1036":{"id":1036,"title":"Personal Repository","description":"Relevant Personal Repository Created using Jekyll","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityapkatre/adityapkatre.github.io/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://adityapkatre.github.io/","repo_link":"https://github.com/adityapkatre/adityapkatre.github.io","slack_id":"U091MG0K16Z","created_at":"2025-06-17T18:07:55.741Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:16:40.898Z","author_name":"adityad39c","author_real_name":"Aditya Katre","author_timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","timezone_offset":-25200,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-16/9069893371425_48fc3193e49e8642956d_192.jpg","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png","author":"Aditya Katre","devlogs":"0","time":"0h 59m"},"1038":{"id":1038,"title":"BloatOS","description":"Despite the name, BloatOS is the complete opposite of bloat.

device will function like this:\nThere is a Main Module with an ESP32 and some useful input devices like sliders, rotary encoders and buttons.\nThe main module connects through either serial USB (the usb-c port on the ESP) or through wifi (udp data stream) to the driver pc where the DAW, Virtual DJ, lighting control or any other software that supports midi runs on.\nOn the sides of this module there should be spring loaded pins and magnets. You can connect other modules to the main module using these pins that are on every module. \nThe modules work through a msp430 (or equivalent). This chip has a unique ID and sends/receives data through all the other modules that are between it and the main module\n\nThis project is only for the PC Driver Software and I will probably add the hardware stuff to the repo and project later.\nThe PC Software will be available on Linux (on which it is developed), Windows and MacOS.\nIt will also be useful for everyone who wants to have a easy software to use a DIY ESP-32 based MIDI input device. I will provide documentation and a Tutorial on how to do this.\n\nTo be transparent: I use AI to generate Styles for the UI, to generate documentation texts (i am not good at writing stuff) and to understand error messages better, but the code is written by me, and the hardware is designed by me.","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://github.com/jrmfrbg/modularMidiDriver/blob/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/jrmfrbg/modularMidiDriver","slack_id":"U091HLS4Q0K","created_at":"2025-06-18T14:10:40.208Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T21:23:10.871Z","author_name":"stern","author_real_name":"Jorim","author_timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","timezone_offset":7200,"author_slack_start_date":"2025-06-15","author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-17/9061109350354_d0fd64199d4d85d8cf98_192.jpg","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgzOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3c5c8a53b023596d677bcdf69f07afbbc8f4fb42/markup_1000010676%20(1).jpg","author":"Jorim","devlogs":"2","time":"9h 2m"},"1343":{"id":1343,"title":"Mini Game Hub","description":"A single-page web application that hosts a collection of fun, classic mini-games.

I have built the app for raspberry Pi 5 which makes it very easy to move outside and have a portable setup. Of course any other computer powerful enough will do the job. The idea came to me when I watched the biathlon finals a couple of weeks ago. On TV they have a camera zoomed in on the targets but I wanted to do something different. I wanted to have a fully digital representation of the targets with accurate point tracking and feedback. This was the first project I have done based on image processing and it has so far been really interesting. I am currently expanding the system to dynamically draw the boundaries for different points on the target. The setup is actually quite easy so if you have an airsoft gun and a webcam laying around, give it a try!","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Toiseo/ShotTracker/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Toiseo/ShotTracker","slack_id":"U091QU4EFUJ","created_at":"2025-06-18T19:35:16.867Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T19:35:16.867Z","author_name":"alfred.wik","author_real_name":"Alfred Wik","author_timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","timezone_offset":7200,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a5f6957c6fed30b83220672655f2a8d6.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0003-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkwNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--93fb192c9f22b88c6cb2fbdf9881ce0db63dc27b/dev1.png","author":"Alfred Wik","devlogs":"1","time":"15h 39m"},"1461":{"id":1461,"title":"Infit-Island","description":"A locally hosted, voice-controlled, AI-powered infinite story simulator","category":"Video Game","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U07DPKEBE5C","created_at":"2025-06-18T19:37:21.171Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T19:37:21.171Z","author_name":"gardodaqqaq","author_real_name":"Mohd Daqqaq","author_timezone":"Asia/Kuwait","timezone_offset":10800,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2024-07-24/7472343931954_fe47429bd02ca4e5a804_192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png","author":"Mohd Daqqaq","devlogs":"0","time":"7h 43m"},"1462":{"id":1462,"title":"Webhook AIO","description":"Just a rewrite of my old discord webhook aio since they changed it up a bit","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Keczuu/Webhook-AIO/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Keczuu/Webhook-AIO","slack_id":"U091R0Y0SCW","created_at":"2025-06-18T19:38:35.945Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T21:16:26.564Z","author_name":"koteczek5184","author_real_name":"Keczuu","author_timezone":"Europe/Warsaw","timezone_offset":7200,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-20/9082385509620_d9a1a757cf0031efaa13_192.jpg","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkwMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e7f2a29cc471e27f336fd46dac8b7fe14e0f37b9/x1Cl6jN.png","author":"Keczuu","devlogs":"0","time":"0h 0m"},"1464":{"id":1464,"title":"AI Text Adventure","description":"Basically, a text adventure that is generated on-the-fly from a single starter prompt using AI.","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunflowerthomas/AI-Text-Adventure/master/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/sunflowerthomas/AI-Text-Adventure","slack_id":"U08TD8TPFGT","created_at":"2025-06-18T19:41:19.997Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T19:41:19.997Z","author_name":"sunflowerthomas","author_real_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_timezone":"Europe/London","timezone_offset":3600,"author_slack_start_date":"2025-05-22","author_pronouns":"He/Him","author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a943deebb1b43e3b06a1bd049effc125.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0018-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjcxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--08b79c7fa83b13b90921455ede29fb1a464f5e74/Screenshot%202025-06-19%20201751.png","author":"sunflowerthomas","devlogs":"2","time":"0h 34m"},"1465":{"id":1465,"title":"Personal Website","description":"My personal website portfolio, written using Nuxt 3 and Tailwinds.

MindPilot was born from this personal frustration, a tool that combines a smart focus assistant with an intelligent tutor, all in a lightweight and accessible web app.\n\nMindPilot allows you to start distraction-free focus sessions using a timer-based system while keeping track of your progress. But what makes it unique is the ability to ask any question or type any topic, and the built-in AI (powered by Cohere’s Command R+ model) explains it in a clear and understandable way. Whether you're struggling with a math concept, a programming topic, or even a piece of history, MindPilot is here to help.\n\nThe project is built using React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. It connects to the Cohere API to generate explanations in real time. A .env system is used to keep API keys safe, and the frontend and backend communicate through REST endpoints.\n\nThroughout the Summer of Making, I plan to extend MindPilot with new features such as:\n\nA personal progress dashboard\nSupport for multiple subjects and languages\nEnhanced session analytics\nAnd eventually, a mobile app version\nThe goal is to turn MindPilot into something that doesn't just help me but could help any student, self-learner, or curious mind around the world. It’s more than a study tool. It’s a digital co-pilot for your brain.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Frezzard2/MindPilot/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Frezzard2/MindPilot","slack_id":"U08S0LWH27P","created_at":"2025-06-18T20:13:52.618Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T20:51:31.531Z","author_name":"kukucska.zsombor","author_real_name":"Zsombor Kukucska","author_timezone":"Europe/Belgrade","timezone_offset":7200,"author_slack_start_date":"2025-05-01","author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-05-13/8909534064960_b2bfd4b083379e777798_192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTk2NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--26f592a4cea641888b3d0dd59d0fd05bbc36a544/Screenshot%202025-06-18%20at%2022.54.36.png","author":"Zsombor Kukucska","devlogs":"6","time":"5h 50m"},"1488":{"id":1488,"title":"Quivy","description":"Quivy is an online platform designed to make quizzes fun, social, and interactive.

My project is called BKFZ SubGHz (stands for Brian's Knockoff Flipper Zero, lol), a custom-built ESP32 device that can scan, record, and replay SubGHz radio signals, kind of like a DIY version of the Flipper Zero!\n<br>\nI built this last October after getting curious about how the Flipper Zero works, and wanted to recreate part of its functionality using cheap AliExpress parts. What started as a small side project I worked on when I was free quickly turned into one of the most challenging projects I’ve ever made. \n<br>\nThe project is powered by an ESP32 (a Wi-Fi microcontroller that runs all the code) which serves a web interface you can access from your phone. The microcontroller is connected to a CC1101 transceiver, which is a chip capable of capturing and replaying SubGHz frequencies like 433 MHz (the Flipper Zero uses this exact same chip from Texas Instruments).\n<br>\nThe entire thing is held together by a custom PCB designed in KiCad to keep it small, and it has added support for .sub files from real Flipper Zeros (so it’s compatible with public files from the flipper community). I also added support for preset modulation to match the Flipper Zero's configuration!\n<br>\nFeatures:\n- Frequency Analyzer: Scan and analyze nearby devices and their frequencies with ease.\n- Record RAW: Capture and record nearby signals with precise RSSI configuration.\n- Replay RAW: Replay previously captured signals from a file (no SD card required).\n- Preset Configuration: Configure the frequency of your device, and set the preset modulation (just like the Flipper Zero!).\n- Flipper Zero Support: Effortlessly replay any Flipper Zero SUB file, including the many publicly available ones, whenever you need.\n<br><br>\nThe following parts were used for the project (~$18.01 total, but you can make a minimal USB-powered one for ~$4.98)\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz/refs/heads/main/Other/Assembly%20Photos/Components/All%20Components.jpeg\" />","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz","repo_link":"https://github.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz","slack_id":"U091MEESEDT","created_at":"2025-06-18T22:27:05.593Z","updated_at":"2025-06-27T05:45:32.221Z","author_name":"walczakbrian6","author_real_name":"Brian","author_timezone":"America/Chicago","timezone_offset":-18000,"author_pronouns":"he/him/his","author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/31003864dfc23dea4addfcd265ed169d.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0017-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjA0NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7276779fe4581c24bfa9e4466a96773dcfe628b6/Step%208.%20Final%20Product.jpeg","author":"Brian Walczak","devlogs":"1","time":"0h 8m"},"1557":{"id":1557,"title":"IDE","description":"👽️ My CLI to fastly initalize new projects !

By focusing on shared academic interests, extracurricular activities and personal values, we help students cut through the noise of generic social networks.\n\nImpact and Vision:\nCampusConnect represents a new approach to student socialization - one that values quality connections over quantity.

game where you and your friends get together. Everyone receives a secret word except for the Impostor. Now, everyone has to say a word. The crewmates have to say a word which tells the other crewmates that they themselves are not the Impostor, and the Impostor tries to mislead them into thinking that person isn't the Impostor. After a few rounds, everyone votes for one player they think is the Impostor. If they get it right, they win; if not, the Impostor wins.\n\nExample: The word is beach\n\nCrewmate1 says: Cocktail (because of beach bar and such things)\nCrewmate2 says: Castle (because of building a sandcastle)\nImpostor1 says: Sun ( because the Imposter understood that the word may be sth about vacation/beach or sth like that)\n\nCurrently, many students, like myself, are playing at school in free time and, for example, in breaks.\n\nThere are many apps being used, but I thought about the people who don't have many friends to play with because there maybe want to play the game too but cant ( xD )  . That's why I want to work on an app where you can play it yourself with AI friends.\n\nI know it sounds like a troll project, and yeah, it was a random thought I had at school, but I kind of liked it. That's why I am programming it.\n\nMy goal is to make an Android & iOS compatible app where you can just play the Impostor game with a few AI Agents.\n\nI also chose this project because normally I mainly write Python or Java backend code, and I want to challenge myself to program some React Native.","category":"Mobile

(https://github.com/TabbycatDebate). In the world of competitive debating (particularly British Parliamentary or World Schools format), Tabbycat is the gold-standard, globally-used software platform for running and recording the results of tournaments.\n\nTabbycat has some great integrated statistical features (like displaying the \"balance\"/one-sidedness of topics based on debate results), but also supports an API so geeks like me can manipulate and aggregate data to our hearts content — and that's exactly what I've done with Tortoiseshell.\n\nJust like Tabbycat hosts debate tabs, Tortoiseshell (a different coat pattern :) is a shell for users to interact with raw tab data from the Tabbycat API. Built with Python and Flask, Tortoiseshell allows debaters to unlock deeper statistical insights from tournaments (like motion balance specifically for rooms above a certain skill percentile, judge score averages, and side/position frequency among breaking teams) and track their performance across tournaments, analyzing long-term patterns and trends.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/w-r-e/tortoiseshell","slack_id":"U0926HMV0MB","created_at":"2025-06-19T20:50:39.826Z","updated_at":"2025-06-19T20:50:39.826Z","author_name":"willope8065","author_real_name":"Liam Evans","author_timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","timezone_offset":-25200,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef0477f0b4de2c0c834e3aacfa7cb26c.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0010-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png","author":"Liam Evans","devlogs":"0","time":"2h 4m"},"1937":{"id":1937,"title":"SImple midi controller","description":"A simple midi controller that i'm making as a sort of macropad but mostly to get experience for a much bigger midi controller.

control dashboard.\n\nIts core goal is to allow users to remotely manage their own computers (Linux or Windows) within a local network or VPN—not through the public internet.\n\nThrough a secure web interface, you can perform actions like shutting down, locking, or controlling media playback on your device from another trusted device on the same network.\n\nThe backend is built for each platform:\n\n    🐧 On Linux, it uses Python and FastAPI for easy scripting and control.\n\n    🪟 On Windows, it uses C++ with the Windows API to maximize control and understanding of system internals.\n\n🔧 Core Features\n\n    Secure login with a lightweight web-based control panel\n\n    System actions: shutdown, lock, sleep, media control\n\n    Cross-platform: Linux and Windows\n\n    Runs locally or over VPN, not exposed to the public web\n\n    Modular backend for easy extension (e.g., custom commands)\n\n    (Optional) Future support for viewing basic system metrics (CPU/RAM, uptime)\n\n    ⚠️ System monitoring features are not part of the core idea and may or may not be implemented.\n\n📄 Descripción del Proyecto (Español)\n\nLocal SysPilot es un panel de control multiplataforma para administrar tu propio sistema desde una red local o una VPN.\n\nEl objetivo principal del proyecto es permitir a los usuarios ejecutar acciones de control del sistema (como apagar, bloquear o controlar el audio/multimedia) desde otro dispositivo de confianza, sin depender de la nube ni exponer nada a Internet.\n\nLa interfaz es web, segura y ligera, y se conecta a un backend que varía según el sistema operativo:\n\n    🐧 En Linux, se usa Python y FastAPI para facilitar la integración y control.\n\n    🪟 En Windows, se usa C++ con la API de Windows para tener control real y aprendizaje profundo del sistema.\n\n🔧 Funcionalidades principales\n\n    Login seguro con panel de control vía navegador\n\n    Acciones del sistema: apagar, bloquear, suspender, controlar multimedia\n\n    Soporte para Linux y Windows\n\n    Solo accesible en red local o VPN (nunca desde Internet pública)\n\n    Backend modular para agregar comandos personalizados fácilmente\n\n    (Opcional) Soporte futuro para ver métricas básicas del sistema (CPU, RAM, uptime)\n\n    ⚠️ Las funciones de monitorización del sistema no forman parte del objetivo principal y podrían no implementarse.","category":"Web

When multiple nearby devices register similar patterns, an earthquake is confirmed and real-time alerts are sent out.\n\nCrowd Confirmation:\nEarthquake events are validated using data from surrounding users’ devices, ensuring high accuracy and reducing false alarms.\n\nDisaster Heatmap (Snapchat-style):\nUsers can post photos and videos from affected areas.

The flashcards are generated using an AI model that understands user input and breaks it into useful Q&A pairs. The site is clean, fast, and works on any device.\n\nWhat makes it special:\n\nIt's made by a student, for students — simple, fast, and distraction-free.\n\nYou don’t need to sign up or download anything — just paste and go.\n\nIt uses AI to actually understand the content and generate useful flashcards, not just summaries.\n\nBuilt transparently using modern tools like Cursor, Bolt, and Lovable, proving that anyone with a vision can build powerful tools today.\n","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"http://locnixai.space/","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U092BRTV1EG","created_at":"2025-06-20T12:29:44.613Z","updated_at":"2025-06-20T12:29:44.613Z","author_name":"kushagramullick7","author_real_name":"Kushagra","author_timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","timezone_offset":7200,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0f57a67f5a491bb28170b19767ed24a0.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0021-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png","author":"Kushagra","devlogs":"0","time":"0h 0m"},"2138":{"id":2138,"title":"HYRA-0","description":"HYRA-0 (Hybird Reasoning Agent - Zero) is an experimental, zero-database reasoning engine built to revolutionize how humans and machines engage with scientific problems.

waste. EcoPantry allows users to login and scan receipts (w/ Google's Tesseract OCR), as well as auto-add groceries to let them keep track of what they have online. The application’s color-coded expiry date tracking prevents users from throwing food away too early and too late, and the implementation of APIs (TheMealDB) allows EcoPantry to recommend recipes for close-to-expiring foods. Statistics are also automatically generated to notify users on their food wastage, savings, and financial waste/savings. A points system is also built-in, rewarding users for good choices. A SQLite database is used to manage login, groceries, and almost everything pertaining to specific users.\n","category":"Something

WAV files store audio as a sequence of “samples”: numbers that represent the value of some audio signal at a particular point in time. WAV files begin with a 44-byte “header” that contains information about the file itself, including the size of the file, the number of samples per second, and the size of each sample. After the header, the WAV file contains a sequence of samples, each a single 2-byte (16-bit) integer representing the audio signal at a particular point in time.\n\nScaling each sample value by a given factor has the effect of changing the volume of the audio. Multiplying each sample value by 2.0, for example, will have the effect of doubling the volume of the origin audio. Multiplying each sample by 0.5, meanwhile, will have the effect of cutting the volume in half.\n\nIn a file called volume.c in a folder called volume, write a program to modify the volume of an audio file.\n\n\nThis project is a problem set from Week 4 of CS50x 2025.","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/code50/120336831/tree/main/volume","slack_id":"U091PCWGNBX","created_at":"2025-06-21T14:15:49.737Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T14:15:49.737Z","author_name":"karman.chhatwal","author_real_name":"Karman Chhatwal","author_timezone":"America/New_York","timezone_offset":-14400,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-16/9071784869457_4fd10533ef20b9eade75_192.jpg","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU5NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8906ae1d48d2a74e052c444e0a2c98dad9ca513c/image%20(1).png","author":"Karman Chhatwal","devlogs":"1","time":"2h 53m"},"2559":{"id":2559,"title":"SoulSearch","description":"A high-performance search engine built from scratch in pure Go.

The system stores user ratings and calculates an average rating for each movie, which is displayed alongside the movie’s details.\n\nAdministrators can manage movie data, including adding, updating, or deleting movie entries. The system ensures that each user can rate a movie only once, but they can update their rating if needed. It may also include search and filter options to help users find movies by genre, release year, or rating. The main goal is to provide an organized way for users to share feedback and for others to discover well-rated content.\n\n","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U091QE83A2Z","created_at":"2025-06-22T12:45:45.424Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T12:45:45.424Z","author_name":"huzaifaahmed811","author_real_name":"Huzaifa Khan","author_timezone":"Asia/Karachi","timezone_offset":18000,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17ab90c497dabdd50753aad7024f1769.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0024-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png","author":"Huzaifa Khan","devlogs":"0","time":"0h 0m"},"2859":{"id":2859,"title":"emotional heatmap","description":"Online map where people can post their current mood and see medium mood from other locations.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U091T0RAE2W","created_at":"2025-06-22T12:46:21.200Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T15:27:36.559Z","author_name":"maksimraklo846","author_real_name":"Maksim","author_timezone":"Europe/Moscow","timezone_offset":10800,"author_slack_start_date":"2025-06-17","author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-17/9063410758485_825248a548717abecc92_192.jpg","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTUxMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--335e65de30a17595fa68cef4afea8ca2cb2c3fe4/d.png","author":"Maksim","devlogs":"5","time":"7h 8m"},"2860":{"id":2860,"title":"JustCool","description":"Just simple text effects  when typing in the textbox *a learning project*.\n>used Gemini for code and Copilot for error correction.\n^Copilot for 50% of code completion and comments in code and README","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aeratory678/justcool/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://aeratory678.github.io/justcool/","repo_link":"https://github.com/aeratory678/justcool","slack_id":"U08RE7RUD9C","created_at":"2025-06-22T12:55:00.975Z","updated_at":"2025-06-26T13:28:45.457Z","author_name":"aeratory678","author_real_name":"aera","author_timezone":"Asia/Kolkata","timezone_offset":19800,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/47589e10abe352db7f5272eae9b4f899.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0014-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTQ5OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c934612301f6ef99b27b3d8c4509618b11b56039/Screenshot_20250626-165623_Chrome.jpg","author":"aera","devlogs":"4","time":"6h 30m"},"2862":{"id":2862,"title":"Let's get going!","description":"A simple Go course that takes you through coding in Go from the beginning.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arzumify/letsgetgoing/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://arzumify.github.io/letsgetgoing/","repo_link":"https://github.com/Arzumify/letsgetgoing","slack_id":"U0922CUK4P8","created_at":"2025-06-22T12:59:34.981Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T13:00:43.104Z","author_name":"snugger.04.sizzler","author_real_name":"Arzumify","author_timezone":"Africa/Monrovia","timezone_offset":0,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1fc717988f3874c2acac6628a9e9db52.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0009-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTU4MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--463e22598051f305e750daeccecf297a4649cbd2/Screenshot_20250622-182853.png","author":"Arzumify","devlogs":"2","time":"4h 11m"},"2863":{"id":2863,"title":"TaskOrganizer","description":"Organize your tasks in the terminal with only your keyboard","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Efe-Cal/TaskOrganizer/main/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/Efe-Cal/TaskOrganizer","slack_id":"U091ZF0JNBG","created_at":"2025-06-22T13:06:21.488Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T13:06:21.488Z","author_name":"efecaliskan08","author_real_name":"Efe Çalışkan","author_timezone":"Asia/Istanbul","timezone_offset":10800,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-19/9067525922198_1cba921e3478bd859369_192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTMzNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--680617f0b85bef18d7642f30cfc7f65df2316ea5/Ekran%20g%C3%B6r%C3%BCnt%C3%BCs%C3%BC%202025-06-22%20160751.png","author":"Efe Çalışkan","devlogs":"1","time":"1h 36m"},"2864":{"id":2864,"title":"CLI Messaging App","description":"A messaging app that used tcp sockets to allow clients to communicate.

By encoding integers as prime exponent vectors, it converts:\nMultiplication → Vector addition\nGCD/LCM → Min/Max operations\nMatrix math → Optimized vector transforms\nThe core innovation exploits prime factorization’s mathematical properties. Modern hardware outperforms this approach for general cases of multiplication due to extreme optimization of traditional arithmetic. The key bottleneck is factorization latency (why RSA works). Today, it’s not viable for multiplication, but one can easily figure out the most efficient cases for it and combine the binary GCD algorithm with the PFS (Prime Factor System) algorithm and then we get an optimized version of the binary GCD and LCM algorithms (the second one is heavily based on GCD).\nFuture quantum integration could revolutionize multiplication too:\nShor’s algorithm would enable efficient factorization\nPractical for huge numbers (n > 2^25 bits based on my calculations)\nTurns prime vectors into an universal accelerator for many operations","category":"Something

For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1 could represent white, as in the below.\n\na simple bitmap\n\nIn this sense, then, is an image just a bitmap (i.e., a map of bits). For more colorful images, you simply need more bits per pixel. A file format (like BMP, JPEG, or PNG) that supports “24-bit color” uses 24 bits per pixel. (BMP actually supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color.)\n\nA 24-bit BMP uses 8 bits to signify the amount of red in a pixel’s color, 8 bits to signify the amount of green in a pixel’s color, and 8 bits to signify the amount of blue in a pixel’s color. If you’ve ever heard of RGB color, well, there you have it: red, green, blue.\n\nIf the R, G, and B values of some pixel in a BMP are, say, 0xff, 0x00, and 0x00 in hexadecimal, that pixel is purely red, as 0xff (otherwise known as 255 in decimal) implies “a lot of red,” while 0x00 and 0x00 imply “no green” and “no blue,” respectively. In this problem, you’ll manipulate these R, G, and B values of individual pixels, ultimately creating your very own image filters.\n\nIn a file called helpers.c in a folder called filter-less, write a program to apply filters to BMPs.\n\nThis is a problem from CS50x, Problem Set 4.","category":"Command Line

Well, I DON'T CARE, HERE IT IS. 🤷‍♀️\n👀 ► You've seen ASCII art demos. You've seen those looping gifs. Cute. 😏 This ain't that.\n✨ ► Vidminal takes [ANY] video file you throw at it—your favorite anime clip 🎬, a movie 🍿, that weird cat video from 2009 😼—and turns it into a live, colorful, animated ASCII art spectacle right in your terminal.\n🎶 ► And it's not just a silent movie. We've got synchronized audio. 🔊 We've got full controls. 🎮 This isn't a toy; it's a legit, if slightly unhinged, [TERMINAL MEDIA PLAYER]. 🚀\n\n---\n\n--- HOW'D I MAKE IT HAPPEN? ---\n🐍 ► It's a Python party! 🎉\n💪 ► I wrangled some of Python's coolest libraries to pull this off:\n🎬 ► `moviepy` & `ffmpeg`: To rip the video and audio apart. ✂️\n🖼️ ► `Pillow`: For the pixel-to-text magic. ✍️\n🔈 ► `pygame`: To blast the sound waves at your ears. 🎧\n🎨 ► `colorama`: To paint everything in glorious 24-bit color. 🌈\n⚡ ► `threading`: To make sure the controls work while the video is playing, because nobody likes a laggy player.\n🗺️ ► It was a journey fueled by caffeine ☕ and a questionable sense of purpose. 🌀\n\n---\n\n--- WHY IS IT AWESOME? ---\n🌟 ► It's pure, unfiltered, terminal power! ✨\n🕹️ ► TOTAL CONTROL: You get a full-fledged player experience. Pause, play, quit, rewind, and fast-forward. Adjust the volume. Mute the chaos. It's all there. ⏯️🎚️\n📦 ► ZERO SETUP: Download the release for your OS and just... run it. 🚀 I bundled `ffmpeg` so you don't have to install a single thing. I did the boring work for you. You're welcome. 🙏\n✅ ► THE BEST PART: YOU ARE THE ARTIST! 🎨 Don't like the default look? Open `options.json` and:\n✍️ ► [CHANGE THE CHARACTERS!] Use `█▓▒░` for a blocky look, or a detailed set like `$@B%8&...`, or even make your own `custom` set! You control the texture of your video! 字符✨\n🎛️ ► [TWEAK THE VISUALS!] Adjust `gamma` and `contrast` to get that perfect moody, cyberpunk, or over-saturated look. ⚙️📊\n🤯 ► Prepare for your friends to look over your shoulder and go, \"WTF?! Is that... a movie... in your terminal?\" 😲\n👍 ► Yes. Yes it is. 😎","category":"Command Line

The system analyzes user profiles, their current group memberships, and department data to intelligently recommend group assignments. It validates these recommendations against organizational policies enforced by OPA, ensuring compliant and optimized group assignments.\n\nThe solution includes:\n1. A React-based Frontend for user selection and result visualization.\n2. A FastAPI-based Backend to handle agent requests and serve the LangGraph engine.\n3. An Okta API Integration Layer for real-time user and group data retrieval.\n4. An OPA Policy Evaluation Layer to block non-compliant group assignments.\n5. Real-time logs for step-by-step traceability.\nThis project streamlines identity governance, enhances security posture, and provides an interactive interface for role analysis and decision-making.\n\nWrapper Layer: Orchestrating the System\nThe Wrapper Layer acts as the central orchestration engine that connects the frontend, backend, LangGraph agent, Okta APIs, and the OPA policy engine in a seamless flow. It provides a unified API interface that simplifies interactions across these distributed components.\n\nKey functions of the Wrapper Layer:\n1. Data Aggregation:\nCollects user and group information from the Okta API and serves it in a cleaned, frontend-friendly format.\n2. Process Invocation:\nSends user data to the LangGraph agent for group suggestion and orchestrates the complete flow from input selection to final decision.\n3. Response Routing:\nHandles asynchronous processing and real-time log streaming to the frontend, ensuring users can track every step of the decision process live.\n4. Abstraction:\nDecouples the complex backend logic from the React frontend, providing clean and minimal APIs for easy consumption.\n5. Modular Branches:\nSupports independent development and versioning of different components (agent, backend, frontend, OPA) by providing a consistent entry point.","category":"Web App","readme_link":"https://github.com/Arbind007/OktaRoleMiningOpa/docs/README.md","demo_link":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hm8cBVmFnxON4KoEWT6lisTBQvBo0Gna/view?usp=sharing","repo_link":"https://github.com/Arbind007/OktaRoleMiningOpa","slack_id":"U092RTUP31Q","created_at":"2025-06-24T07:00:20.712Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T12:01:48.126Z","author_name":"almbbsr456","author_real_name":"Arbind Mishra","author_timezone":"Asia/Kolkata","timezone_offset":19800,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-23/9088135625878_cfb98c4406519ff4fd75_192.jpg","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzMyOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--325027b761792e2e59bbe4419da68cfcc10dad65/detailed_flow_diagram.jpg","author":"Arbind Mishra","devlogs":"2","time":"4h 34m"},"3378":{"id":3378,"title":"Annova X75 Firmware","description":"The Firmware for my Hackboard, QMK + VIA Support","category":"Something else","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnav-kr/AnnovaX75/refs/heads/main/firmware/QMK/readme.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/arnav-kr/AnnovaX75/blob/main/firmware/annova_x75.uf2","repo_link":"https://github.com/arnav-kr/AnnovaX75/tree/main/firmware","slack_id":"U079SNC1PFF","created_at":"2025-06-24T07:04:35.328Z","updated_at":"2025-06-27T14:44:19.244Z","author_name":"ak","author_real_name":"Arnav Kumar","author_timezone":"Asia/Kolkata","timezone_offset":19800,"author_pfp":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b59e3f65e367f1f55d6e3f1591916e63.jpg?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0015-192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzMyOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4f881ae8927ea7efc085cc92b2af4fd531417b33/Pasted%20image.png","author":"Arnav","devlogs":"1","time":"2h 53m"},"3379":{"id":3379,"title":"zendev","description":"Zendev is a next gen developer platform","category":"Web App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U092QDJRD9T","created_at":"2025-06-24T07:04:39.776Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T07:04:39.776Z","author_name":"flameo.averest","author_real_name":"Flameo","author_timezone":"Asia/Katmandu","timezone_offset":20700,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-24/9080119789447_6f7dd42fbd4071649554_192.jpg","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzM4MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--263afb2086dfcfc1ba66c23b8e0785f65156b377/Screenshot%202025-06-24%20141219.png","author":"Flameo","devlogs":"1","time":"1h 16m"},"3380":{"id":3380,"title":"Flashcards CLI","description":"A flashcards app in the command line.","category":"Command Line Tool","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamalbu/flashcards-CLI/master/README.md","demo_link":"","repo_link":"https://github.com/adamalbu/flashcards-CLI","slack_id":"U06C0TGFGVA","created_at":"2025-06-24T07:16:53.507Z","updated_at":"2025-06-24T07:16:53.507Z","author_name":"albu.adam","author_real_name":"Adam Albu","author_timezone":"Europe/London","timezone_offset":3600,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2024-10-21/7935349362944_0ae8f3b794a4e2d7f84e_192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzMzMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2c04c7688da35a986d8d08e55d635c802361d523/Screenshot_20250624_081807.png","author":"Random10xDev","devlogs":"2","time":"4h 3m"},"3381":{"id":3381,"title":"ExpressBuddy","description":"**ExpressBuddy** is a first-of-its-kind mobile app that uses a cartoon-style AI avatar to help children with autism, speech delays, or social anxiety improve nonverbal communication and social-emotional skills.

The player controls a spaceship that must survive waves of falling meteors and guided rockets while shooting bullets to destroy obstacles. The game features dynamic difficulty, evolving bullet types, sound effects, and custom-designed sprites.\n\n Features:\n\nPlayer Movement: Left and right arrow keys control a spaceship character.\n\nShooting Mechanics: Pressing the Space key fires bullets that vary in size, color, and damage based on score progression.\nFalling Meteors: Multiple meteor types fall from random positions with increasing health and speed over time.\nGuided Rockets: After a certain score, rockets start chasing the player, adding more challenge.\nSound Effects: A shooting sound plays when the player fires (with plans to toggle it via settings).\nCollision Detection: Meteors and rockets damage the player, while bullets reduce enemy health.\nScore System: Hitting and destroying meteors increases the player’s score.\n\nMenu System (In Progress): The game starts with a menu including “Play” and “Options” (to toggle sound), high score, and exit.\n\nSpecial Meteors (Planned): Some meteors will boost the player's life instead of harming them.\n\nPause/Resume functionality with the ESC key.\nGame over play again instead of closeing. \nChoose sound or not and control the volume of

Unlike those platforms, which rely on centralized warehouses and exclude local shopkeepers, TrustVendor operates without godowns. Instead, it provides a digital storefront to any local vendor, enabling them to sell their products online and fulfill orders within 10–30 minutes in their area.\n\nThe platform allows customers to browse items from nearby stores, place orders, and receive fast delivery — all while supporting local businesses. Vendors can sign up easily, manage inventory, and handle orders through a simple interface without any technical expertise. Payments are processed securely through UPI and cards, and deliveries are managed via store-based coordination or local delivery partners.\n\nThis project is my attempt to democratize access to quick-commerce infrastructure by giving real-world stores the same digital capabilities as corporate chains — without needing to own a warehouse or a private delivery fleet. TrustVendor aims to make local commerce more competitive, efficient, and sustainable by using technology to level the playing field.","category":"Mobile App","readme_link":"","demo_link":"","repo_link":"","slack_id":"U091Z3M7YRY","created_at":"2025-06-25T17:13:34.906Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T17:13:34.906Z","author_name":"francisjyothiscr7","author_real_name":"franco francis","author_timezone":"Asia/Kolkata","timezone_offset":19800,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-26/9102208218067_233e7cc4cbaf7f45d772_192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png","author":"franco francis","devlogs":"0","time":"0h 4m"},"3741":{"id":3741,"title":"space bar clicker","description":"count how many times you click the space bar\n\nHAVE FUN!!!","category":"Video Game","readme_link":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NIVLACvt/space-bar-clicker/refs/heads/main/README.md","demo_link":"https://github.com/NIVLACvt/space-bar-clicker/blob/main/cinnamon-2025-06-25T170219-0400.webm","repo_link":"https://github.com/NIVLACvt/space-bar-clicker","slack_id":"U092L2C47D5","created_at":"2025-06-25T17:27:40.678Z","updated_at":"2025-06-25T22:48:57.170Z","author_name":"calvinlknight","author_real_name":"Calvin Knight","author_timezone":"America/New_York","timezone_offset":-14400,"author_pfp":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2025-06-25/9103525325700_e247afe0d3ef3940a6da_192.png","is_author_deleted":false,"imageUrl":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTA2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b7b828ed673f2fecf450fd87f487700ce138d179/space_clicker-final-final.png","author":"Calvin Knight","devlogs":"2","time":"1h 13m"},"3742":{"id":3742,"title":"Cosmic Defender","description":"Built With 🧑‍💻\nThis game is built entirely with pure JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS3, without any outside dependencies or libraries.
