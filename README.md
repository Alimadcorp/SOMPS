## Devlog:
### [6/24/2025]
Starting with backend, we fetch the project list from the SOM API, we fetch the list of all hackclub slack users, and we incorporate all users names into the project list
This will allow searching by author name
Creating getbanners.js, that uses the pages browse endpoint to fetch all project banners
-- Didnt sleep between here --
